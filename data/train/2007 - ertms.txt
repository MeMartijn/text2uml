This document defines the functional requirements for ERTMS/ETCS (EUROPEAN RAIL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM / EUROPEAN TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM). The document primarily defines the operational requirements and therefore contains only a few technical terms. For consistency reasons, all functional requirements not implemented in the SRS 2.3.0 have been removed from this version.
In the requirements of this document: 	(M) = Mandatory:The requirement shall be respected in every ETCS application. The applicable requirements stated in ETCS SRS and lower level mandatory specifications shall be respected; 	(O) = Optional:It is not mandatory to implement this function in every ETCS application. If implemented, the applicable requirements stated in ETCS SRS and lower level mandatory specifications shall be respected. Note that the CCS TSI may define specific conditions, where implementation of O functions may be required for safety reasons.
ETCS shall provide the driver with information to allow him to drive the train safely.
ETCS shall be able to supervise train and shunting movements.
If the supervision is performed by a RBC it shall be possible to prevent movements of a traction unit in its area if not authorised by the RBC.
ETCS is required to be functional to a maximum train speed of 500 km/h.
The following definitions shall apply for the ETCS application levels: 	 	Level 0: ETCS active for limited train control function; trackside not fitted with any train control system or fitted with a train control system for which no STM is available onboard; 	Level 1: Basic track to train information via intermittent transmission media, e.g. balises. This information can be supported by infill, transmitted via balise, loop or radio; 	Level 2: Basic track to train and train to track information via continuous transmission media, i.e. radio. The train detection is provided by trackside; 	Level 3: Same as level 2 except that train integrity is provided by onboard and therefore trackside. train detection is optional; 	Level STM (Specific Transmission Module): Track to train information provided by national system.
