The goal of Get Real is to encourage more Oregon students to choose computer science and related majors, eventually increasing the number of computer science graduates from Oregon universities. Maintaining a teen friendly site is deemed of highest importance in order to hold student attention and guide the viewer to information that will lead to a decision to pursue a career in CS. Benefits for using the site should include: Personal and Career information from a broad spectrum of CS professionals; CS course and other information from OUS campuses; Timely and up to date information that encourages readers to return to the site, may include Q &amp; A; Call to action, and plans for students to follow to prepare for a CS career.",

        "Users are typical Oregon high school students, grades 9 to12 in ALL high schools across Oregon. Two potential groups of viewers (students) exist: 1) students interested in CS finding more concise information about a CS career, and 2) college bound students not necessarily interested in CS who might be attracted to a CS career with the right \u201cpush\u201d from information on the Get Real site. A third group of students might be those interested careers as diverse as protein research, weather prediction, neurobotics, medicine, law or other sciences where a CS minor could contribute to a better understanding of data and information. A \u201cConsider a CS minor\u201d section could provide helpful information. Oregon High school students from several schools and classes were interviewed to gain their feedback on version 1 of the Get Real site. Common themes emerged in the need to change/update overall site graphic design and real people. Students who are not generally interested in CS, suggested graphic design changes, more white space, pictures, and easier to navigate pages. This group was much less tolerant of the site than the CS folks had been. They wanted a site that \u201cspoke to them\u201d and felt that if you were not a computer science student, it had very little to offer. The suggestion was very strong that the site be broken into more readable chunks of information. The term \u201cwalls of text\u201d appeared several times. The need for more visually attractive information also was a central theme. They wanted color, photos, diagrams, charts, etc. to break up the text and make the site attractive. Many of them commented positively on the spinning globe and satellite menu. Students who are interested in CS and engineering suggested changes in the Real People, Resources, and Colleges sections. Most of them spent their time in the college comparison chart, and in the real people part of the site. It sounded like they were attracted by the pictures. Several commented positively on the sections in each person\u2019s story. The college comparison chart again scored positive marks. Changes to version 2 should include design changes to all existing pages to shorten up paragraphs and add bullets and charts where possible to accommodate faster page reading and shorter reader attention span. One example used on the engineergirl.org site uses an interactive table menu for more detailed information, leaving the main pages short and to the point. \"Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.

        "KeePass Password Safe is a small system that can be easily transferred from computer to computer by a simple USB stick. Its purpose is to solve a problem that really bothers many people today when they have to choose from memorizing a lot of passwords to be secure or to use every time the same one so they won\u2019t forget it but risk be found out by others. So it provides you a very secure, encrypted database where you can keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them. That is because KeePass Password Safe can lock every database with only one Master Password and/or key file. There are no duplicates, anywhere in your computer, of this Master Password and/or key file so in case of lost database cannot be opened by anyone. Not even by you and that is because there is no recovery password or back door. KeePass Password Safe beside security also provides you with several functionalities in order to keep your database organized and up to date. Those are analyzed in the following pages. More about KeePass you can find out at http://keepass.info/",
        "More about KeePass can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/ In this website you can find out more about the project and discuss any questions in the forums. You can go back and look at previous releases, code and problems that have been solved. There you can also find information about the developers as well as the project\u2019s main characteristics such as programming language and algorithms; http://keepass.info/ This is project\u2019s official website where you can find links to all above and also find features available for downloading such as language translations and plug-ins.",
        "KeePass consists of a database which contains data for one or more users. Each user\u2019s data are divided into groups and subgroups so that they are organized in a form that serves right the user. Every user has a unique Master Key which can be simple or composite and its combination opens uniquely the database. If lost there is no recovery. Groups and subgroups contain entries with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be sent or copied to websites, application and accounts. There is also the ability for a onetime key creation to be used once in a transaction without the risk of reused by others for any reason. In the diagram below there are the main components of the system, subsystem interconnections and external interfaces to help you understand the main idea of KeePass. All of them are analyzed with more details in this document.",
        "KeePass Password Safe provides the user with the following functions: Database \u2013 New, Open, Close, Save, Print, Search, Import, Export User can create a new database locked by a Master Key. The database can be opened and closed whenever user wants it. Changes on the data are permitted and the changes can be saved. The user also can print all data in order to keep them with him even when a computer is not available. Also the user can search the database using key words through a search engine provided with the software. Last but not least, the database can be imported and/or exported from/to the Internet; Group/Subgroup \u2013 Add, Modify, Delete, Find Data are organized in groups and subgroups in the order that user wants and finds effective. Those groups can be modified whenever. New groups and subgroups can be added easily and can be deleted the same way. The feature of searching can be applied in just one group and not in the whole database if wanted; Entry \u2013 Add, View/Edit, Duplicate, Delete A new entry can be added in any group or subgroup and it contains title, username, password, URL and notes. Not all fields are required for an entry. An entry can be duplicated and deleted in the click of a button; Change Language At KeePass website there are available language translations that can be downloaded and applied easily; Auto-Type The user can select a sequence of keypresses that KeePass will be able to perform and send them to any window or browser; Command Line Options The user can pass a file path in the command line in order for KeePass to open this file at startup; Composite Master Key To open a database you must use all key sources such as password, key file and/or Windows account details that were used when the Master Key was created. All these together form the Composite Master Key and are all required in order to open the database. So the user cannot use a combination of them to unlock the database; Configuration This feature is used to explain how KeePass store its configuration and where. \u00b7 Import/Export KeePass can support importing data from CSV files, Code Wallet, Password Safe and Personal Vault; Integration KeePass uses Global Hot Key to restore KeePass main window and Limit to single instance option to run only one instance of KeePass at a time; Password Generator There are available generations based on character sets and based on patterns the first for generating random passwords and the second for creating passwords which require specific patterns. There is also available generating passwords that follow rules which are determined further down on this document. Then there are security-reducing options which reduce the security of the passwords they are applied to. Finally there are configuring settings of automatically generated passwords for new entries so that a random password will automatically be created by KeePass when a new entry is wanted; Secure Edit Controls KeePass offers the ability for passwords and data to be appeared behind asterisks when the user wants it. When this option is turned on, secure edit controls stronger than the ones of Windows are protecting your data and no one can access them, see them or steal them; TAN Support KeePass uses TAN-Transaction Authentication Numbers for even more security. This feature can be used for generating one time passwords so that there won\u2019t be any chance, for anyone to access e.g. your bank account even if he finds out that password. That is because when the password is entered one time it becomes useless. TANs can be added using the TANs wizard; URL Field The URL field supports various special protocols and placeholders and can be used for Standard capabilities where URL field can execute valid URLs for which a protocol handler is defined. In addition to that, KeePass supports all registered protocols that Internet Explorer supports. URL field also offers the ability of executed command lines instead of URLs. Also, placeholders can be used that will be automatically replaced when the URL is executed; Using Stored Passwords Passwords that are stored in the database can be copied to website accounts and applications with security and without retyping them again. This can be done by several methods such us Context-Sensitive Password List, Drag and Drop, Auto-Type and KeeForm. All of them are explained better further down; Lock Workspace Last but not least at all is the locking workspace feature. This feature is turned on and locks the database when minimized. So to unlock it the Master Key is required again. The workspace can be locked manually as well by selecting this option from File menu.",
        "Advanced end users: users that are familiar with programming and can personalize their database by creating auto-types, using command line options and generally can use features and maybe expand their use by adding more functions; End users/Desktop: users with no particular knowledge on computer programming. They just use the database for organizing their data and to keep them safe; System administrators: administrators working on computers that support a lot of accounts and personal data for other users. Using KeePass the administrator can save all data with no risk of leak to third persons; Science/Research Telecommunications: for organizing data that have to do with lots of people and applications; Industry: for one-time passwords that can be used for testing controls or for expired entries to gain access in particular systems and programs; Other Audience.",
        "KeePass should run on Operating Systems: WINE, 32-bit MS Windows (95/98), 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP), All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP),Win2K, WinXP, Microsoft Windows Server 2003.

Nothing more than these is required for a fully functional KeePass. KeePass should run perfectly on older releases without any features limitations or data loss.",
        "Timing requirements in KeePass Password Safe: When a password is copied for any reason, (e.g. copy to an application, account, and website) it remains in the memory for only 10 seconds. After 10 seconds pass there is nothing to paste and you have to recopy again. That provides security in a case a password is copied and not pasted anywhere so no one can find it out by pasting later. Language Requirements in KeePass Password Safe: Not in all translations translated help files and tutorials are available. Specific Technologies used in KeePass Password Safe: In order to keep the user\u2019s data fully protected, 2 very secure algorithms are used: Cipher Block Size Key Size Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) 128 bits 256 bits Twofish 128 bits 256 bits In both algorithms every time the user saves a database, a random 128-bit initialization vector is generated; For the creation of the 256-bit key the Cipher uses, the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-256 is used; All the bytes needed for the Initialization Vector, the master key salt, etc are generated via pseudorandom sources: current tick count, performance counter, system date/time, mouse cursor position, memory status, active window focus handles, window message stack, process heap status, process startup information and several system information structures; When the KeePass is active, all passwords are stored encrypted in process memory so in order for them to be completely safe the ARC4 encryption algorithm is used, using a random 12 bytes long key.",

        "This preface provides a short overview about the comments received from the EC and other sources and how these comments and remarks will be taken into consideration in future/ongoing work. The review reflected that WP2 presents with its deliverable D2.1 \u201can ambitious, high quality vision, reflected in a 4 stage maturity model, which is well argued.\u201d The general feedback received for this document was positive, especially highlighting various insightful remarks. On the other hand the review process has generated some criticism which will be addressed by WP2 in future works. The following description responds to these comments and criticism by arguing how and where revisions and updates of the work presented in this deliverable will be implemented in subsequent results of WP 2. First of all, D2.1 will be updated and improved in the following respects: The executive summary will be elaborated and improved in the upcoming Version 1.2; The goals of chapter 3 will be described in more detail. The term \u201cframework\u201d thereby seems to be misleading and will be replaced by a more suitable expression. The general descriptions and structure of chapter 3 will be maintained. Responding to criticism from the review, strong interconnections will be added to the subsequent deliverable D2.2, which will give a more detailed description of the organisational, semantic, technical and legal specifications of the VCD concept. In D2.2., the requirements stated in D 2.1 will be reconsidered and transformed into a tabular collection of functional and non-functional requirements grouped for different components of the overall VCD concept (see subsequent contents of D 2.2); The conclusions will be amended in the upcoming Version 1.2 of D 2.1. A request was made to further detail the generic scope and nature of D2.1. WP 2 will respond to this request by adding interrelations of D2.1 with D2.2, which aims at the detailed specifications of the VCD concept, pilot and components. WP 2 planned the first deliverable as laying the basis for the subsequent detailed specifications, i.e. focus was put on the analysis and general concept of a VCD. It should be noted that such a VCD concept currently does not exist. Even in CEN BII, only an early draft of a qualification profile exists. Hence, the first specification document of WP 2 was dedicated to general analysis and overall concept with an analysis of requirements at organisational, semantic, technical and legal level. The subsequent deliverable D2.2 will convey the specifications and design of the individual VCD components, including the pilot designs, hence detailing and counterbalancing the requirements of D 2.1 with conceptual descriptions / specifications. The following components of the VCD implementation will be covered within D2.2: The pre-VCD mapping pilot (subsequently called European VCD service), which is a tool that informs an economic operator about what evidences s/he has to provide in order to comply with the selection and exclusion criteria set out in a call for tender or contract notice of a contracting authority in another country: This service will comprise of an ontology, an ontology manager and a VCD interaction tool, which does the reasoning (mapping) and provides the interface for a user to query the ontology for the mapping. The tool will furthermore generate a VCD package skeleton based on the VCD schema. With this structure, the VCD service provider can easily insert the evidences and pack everything into a VCD package for the requestor (economic operator); The VCD schema specification comprised of a logical data model and a physical representation in XML will be the standard format to ensure interoperable VCD package implementation; The VCD services which will compile VCD packages in five pilot member states (after the PEPPOL enlargement procedure, three new pilots have been added to WP 2): These VCD services will implement a number of services to query and collect evidences from different issuing bodies and to pack the individual evidences into a full VCD package thereby also extracting certain metadata and context specific data which will facilitate machine-readability and quick evaluation of a VCD package; Besides above technical specifications, the evaluation of legal compliance of these technical specifications is performed. The results of these evaluations will be fed into the specifications of the components indicated above; Likewise, organisational specifications will detail the processes of interaction between users, the scenarios for the production pilots, test and evaluation guidelines as well as business models of pilots, and governance and maintenance structures to ensure long-term sustainability. One of the comments was that a structured review of the state of practice is missing in this report. WP2 has strongly interconnected D2.1 to the state of practice report published by DG market1: 'eCertificates' feasibility study (Preliminary study on the electronic provision of certificates and attestations usually required in public procurement procedures). In reference to this, D2.2 will comprise a short overview of the updated state of practice and the relation to current more detailed results of WP2.",
        "The effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enable interoperability in public procurement is an area of great significance for achieving the Lisbon objectives, i.e. to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world (EC 2005). However, the current European public eProcurement infrastructure is inappropriate because it is characterized by a high market fragmentation and a lack of interoperability. Hence, a major objective of the European Commission is to enable European-wide eProcurement across borders by creating common principles and technical solutions that are applied within all Member States. eProcurement requires efforts to be done by public administrations, in particular to exploit new technologies for interoperability that enable easy information accessibility, improving the availability of pan-European services and interaction among citizens and businesses (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004). Governments are the largest buyer in the European Union which purchase at a level of approximately 15-20% of GDP (Ministerial_Declaration 2005). Governments are lagging behind major industries in exchanging relevant data with key actors such as suppliers. Common standards for electronic data exchange seem to be a key element for companies to participate in public eProcurement. A Europeanwide eProcurement infrastructure could save governments up to 5% on expenditure and the transaction costs for both buyers and suppliers could be reduced by 50-80%. A greater competition and efficiency in eProcurement will influence the whole economy and may also play an important role in achieving the Lisbon objectives, e.g. to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledgebased economy in the world (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004). The Manchester ministerial declaration of 24 November 2005 defines the target that ((Ministerial_Declaration 2005) p.4): \u201cBy 2010 all public administrations across Europe will have the capability of carrying out 100% of their procurement electronically, where legally permissible, thus creating a fairer and more transparent market for all companies independent of a company\u2019s size or location within the single market. By 2010 at least 50% of public procurement above the EU public procurement threshold will be carried out electronically. Over the period 2006-2010 Member States will focus their efforts on delivering those high impact services in Europe which will contribute most to the achievement of the Lisbon Agenda.\u201d It is expected that an interoperable eProcurement infrastructure ensures equal treatment and nondiscrimination and that it facilitates fairer and more effective competition in the European market by enabling suppliers to compete in an open and transparent way. However, current eProcurement infrastructures are inappropriate to reach this ambitious aim since these are characterized by a high market fragmentation. A lack of interoperability \u2013 different, non-operable and incompatible technical solutions \u2013 hinders suppliers in accessing eProcurement systems and discourages their participation cause of additional difficulties or increased costs (Commission_Staff_Working_Document 08.07.2005). Across Europe, eProcurement systems have already been developed with a focus on the automation of different eProcurement procedures. Current systems reflect various country-specific public procurement needs and national laws, priorities, and practices. Systems are either centrally oriented or designed to reflect federated systems demands. In addition, varying terminologies are used within the European Member States. The lack of a unified eProcurement terminology is a major barrier which affects the possibility of a smooth collaboration between Member States and their eProcurement systems (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004). Legal, technical and organisational barriers prevent the development of a common Procurement infrastructure and are one of the greatest challenges to be solved by politics, governments, ICT industry and research (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004). To facilitate EU-wide interoperability in public eProcurement, the European Commission co-funds the PEPPOL project in the ICT Policy Support Programme within the Competiveness and Innovation framework Programme (CIP). PEPPOL2 aims at setting up pan-European pilot solutions that conjointly exist with national infrastructures. Among the building blocks the PEPPOL consortium develops, the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) focuses on an interoperable solution which contains the documents required from economic operators to evidence their qualification as well as qualitative selection or exclusion according to the directive 2004/18/EC.",
        "A VCD will facilitate electronic Tendering by providing cross-border data and document solution that contains the necessary attestations and certificates typically required in eTendering. Thus it can be seen as a container for documents. Yet up to now, the tendering documents such as attestations and certificates required in public procurement procedures differ between Member States. When a contracting authority publishes a contract notice, it shall include the selection, qualification and nonexclusion criteria. The economic operators have to submit evidence and proof in respect of these criteria. Hence, during the preparation of the tender an economic operator needs to collect the respective evidences (i.e. certificates and qualification documents) from a number of issuing bodies (e.g. public registries, banks, pre-qualification bodies, etc.) to prove conformance with the given selection and exclusion criteria. The overall aims and expectations of a virtual company dossier solution as set out in the description of work can be described as follows: 1. The VCD will support any authorised entities (economic operator, intermediary, contracting authority or IT service such as an eTendering system) in creating an electronic information package consisting of the required documentation, evidences, proof, attestations, certificates, declarations and metadata; 2. In order to create the VCD, an implemented IT system will have to collect certificates and attestations from existing registries. It also enables the economic operator to add self-declarations or other documents of formal qualification; 3. Furthermore, the VCD solution supports economic operators in producing a VCD and in enabling them to submit the required documentation (assembled as an information package) to any contracting authority in Europe; 4. In the same way the VCD as an implemented IT system will enable contracting authorities or their eTendering systems to interpret and accept the documentation submitted by the economic operator; 5. Therefore the contracting authority must either specify the documentation that has to be submitted by economic operator or the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion that have to be fulfilled by the economic operator; 6. For all parties (economic operator, intermediary, contracting authority, issuing bodies) it will be of high importance that the VCD Service Providers are trustworthy; this implies that the services are precise, up-to-date, available and reliable. A major challenge of PEPPOLs\u2019 work package 2 is to integrate various stakeholders in the development process and to set up an IT system which supports a common set of evidences based on electronic business certificates and qualification documents that are most frequently required. The criteria must be consistent with directive 2004/18/EC (EC 30.04.2004): Article 45 - Personal situation of the candidate or tenderer: e.g. absence of conviction,bankruptcy, fulfilment of payments of social security contributions or taxes, etc; Article 46 - suitability to pursue a professional activity: e.g. certificate of registration from thecommercial register; Article 47 - economic and financial standing: e.g. balance sheets; Article 48 - technical and/or professional ability of economic operators, e.g. certificates ofsatisfactory execution of past works; Article 49 - quality assurance standards, e.g. ISO certificates; Article 50 - environmental management standards; (Article 51 - Additional documentation and information). Criteria are listed in the Directive and can be established by the contracting authority within the contract notice. A key aspect in the VCD development is to support a common set of criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion derived from the directive and their fulfilment through evidences. Work package 2 will not implement a common set of attestations. Thereby it must be taken into account that some countries do not issue such documents or certificates (e.g. in Norway extracts from the judicial record may be produced in respect of economic operators, but not in respect of private persons, for the purpose of a tender procedure) and this hinders economic operators to evidence certain criteria. In such cases, economic operators can only provide similar evidences that fulfil the same criteria. Where the country in question does not issue such documents or certificates, or where these do not cover all the cases they may be replaced by a declaration on oath, a solemn declaration, a notary or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country whence that person comes. So the link between individual evidences and the respective criteria they may approve for (as listed above) must be precisely indicated and mapped in order to support economic operators in their activity. Besides the mapping of criteria and evidences in a respective country, directive 2004/18/EC indicates also the need for accessibility of \u201cOfficial lists of approved economic operators and certification by bodies established under public or private law\u201d (cf. Article 52). Article 52 indicates a potential solution which may be addressed in the VCD development too.",
        "The status quo concerning the tendering process, observed in the European countries of this work package, is depicted in a generic status-quo procedure as shown in Figure 1. The procedure can be described as follows: A Contracting Authority prepares a call for tender based on a set of documents, usually consisting of a) the publication of a contract notice b) the tender contract documentation c) the (technical) specifications, d) additional documents. The contract notice is produced and transmitted to the official gazette such as the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) when due. It should be noted that for public tenders above a certain threshold, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (TED) is mandatory. Public tenders below that threshold can use other channels for the contract notice (depending on national legislation; e.g. contract notices may be mandatory in national official gazettes). Also tendering platforms can be used by the contracting authority (1). The steps of publishing the contract notice are part of \u201ceNotification\u201d3. An Economic Operator can use means such as the TED system, existing tendering platforms or official national gazettes to search for contract notices (2) and to retrieve the relevant information about active tenders (3). The online TED system provides broad advertising and presence of \u201ccontract notices\u201d within the TED database. TED publications of contract notices usually contain the tender and contract documentation including detailed criteria, specifications and conditions. Almost all the TED\u2019s contract notices have a summary of the requirements in other languages set by the Contracting Authority. The mandatory publication of contract notices in TED is a means to ensure transparency for public procurement throughout Europe and to enable a well functioning inner market. For contract notices below threshold, TED can also complement existing national sources through widespread information across borders. Sometimes, the information on a contract notice provided in TED is not complete. Hence, the Economic Operator must directly get the authentic contract notice and exact conditions from the Contracting Authority in order to avoid a failure on interpreting the requirements for participation. If an Economic Operator decides to participate in a public tender across border, the appropriate selection and exclusion criteria have to be evaluated. This means that the Economic Operator has to match these criteria set out in the contract notice of another country with the evidences (attestations, statements and certificates) of his or her own country in order to prove compliance (4). The attestations can be retrieved from the appropriate issuing bodies such as certifiers, source registers, banks, public authorities, etc. in the country where the Economic Operator is established (5). The step of retrieving proofs of suitability and non-exclusion and collecting documents for the receiving entities becomes a necessary task and may take place at different times. In some European Member State countries the \u201cself-declaration\u201d (a statement issued by the Economic Operator) is adopted to claim an initial suitability for applying and attending a tender. In this case, Economic Operators may retrieve their proofs of suitability only at a later stage if necessary at all. In most cases an official translation of the documents submitted by the Economic Operator is required (6). Some European countries are also imposing the submission of legally attested documents. In this case, accredited official translators, lawyers or notaries have to issue such legally attested translations of evidences. The following flows of documents have to be considered specifically: documents that cannot be generated in the target language by the originating authority; documents produced by the Economic Operator such as self declarations; documents that must be accessed by the contracting authority from the official source. Finally, the translated documents are submitted to the contracting authority (7) which checks their compliance with the appropriate (legal) requirements (8). Steps (7) and (8) are performed through separated incremental cycles according to the established practice in the country of execution. In some countries, the initial submission covers only the application with its set of declarations (twophased tendering). At a later stage and under an explicit request there is the real submission of the requested documents. To give a flavour of diverging procedures in regards to document handling (6) in WP 2 partner countries: European Member States such as France and Germany accept legally binding self-declarations. In Austria the current status is that each Economic Operator has to perform the full delivery of documents. In the case of a two-phased tendering (e.g. when negotiating with the Economic Operators), the submission of the documents is performed in the first phase. Each Economic Operator usually has to submit a full set of documents proving his suitability. Currently a new version of the Austrian Federal Procurement Act is elaborated which will probably change the necessity for the Economic Operator to just give a declaration on oath concerning the Economic Operator\u2019s suitability. The contracting authority will demand the full list of documents (depending on the procurement process) just from those Economic Operator which either are selected for the second phase or which are selected as the winner(s) in a one-phase process. Summing up the document handling of different countries, in most countries the management of documents that bear legal validity falls into the general arena of public documents handling - that means: outside the pure procurement context. France follows a two step approach: the Economic Operator first sends his offer and the selfdeclarations (no bankruptcy, no conviction, compliance with employment obligations, etc.); the second sub-step concerns only the contractor and consists in sending social and fiscal attestations and, if necessary, the copy of the decision of the judicial procedure. Italy adopts the \u201cDirectAccess\u201d to documents and information records managed by public administrations. This solution removes from the Economic Operator the duty and burden to get and submit these specific attestations. Countries such as Norway may follow yet another approach by requesting a set of formal documents (i.e. those regulated by law) to be submitted by the Economic Operator at the time of the tender. Other documents, e.g. a bank guarantee if this is asked for, can be delivered later on in the procurement process.",
        "A major point of discussion is a sustainable and reliable long-term vision for exchanging attestations among Member States. In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the contracting authorities\u2019 need to prove suitability and non-exclusion of economic operators according to certain criteria while reducing the burden of proof for the economic operator. This requires a paradigm shift towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and certificates that are currently just barely available in electronic form. The creation of uniform infrastructure in this heterogeneous domain will take some time as several different environments and stakeholders need to be involved, and change may not be enforceable to all of them. In this respect the VCD should support current practices of exchanging evidence in the short run and lead towards smooth, reliable and sustainable exchange of electronic evidences among Member States in the long run. In order to reach these goals we propose an approach with different stages of maturity that may be applied dependent on the readiness for the individual Member State. The aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels. Thereby each maturity level is built upon the lower ones thus allowing integration and step by step advancement. In the following we will introduce the staged maturity model for the VCD as depicted in Figure 2. The stages express different levels of maturity with respect to interoperability. A staged implementation approach is necessary in order to handle the complexity of the domain and to take into account the needs of the Member States. Every Member State should develop a solution that meets the demands of basic interoperability. Basic interoperability can thereby be defined as a state where organisational transparency of cross-border tendering requirements is established (stage 1- pre-VCD mapping tool). The efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought to be manageable and affordable.Member States, who would like to advance their solution towards a higher level of interoperability, can do so by adopting subsequent VCD maturity levels. The VCD specification must be generically and semantically extensible in order to reach a sustainable and fully-fledged solution in the final stage. An eTendering system and a contracting authority must be able to interpret a VCD package assembled by a VCD application regardless of the implementation stage of the VCD application and the eTendering system. Figure 2 illustrates the staged maturity model of the VCD that has been designed to show the different stages of implementation and development. In terms of construction and implementation, the VCD may be seen as a solution focusing on the European interoperability on the basis of European/national requirements and legislation. It is therefore necessary to ensure national transparency by gathering national requirements on certificates and qualification documents. The first implementation level (stage 1) is dependent upon these national requirements and will define a basic semantic interoperability model that supports the mutual recognition of certificates and qualification documents (pre-VCD mapping tool). The next step then is to define the structure of a VCD by adding several types of (meta)data into it (e.g. evidences, structural data of the evidences, translations etc.) and to build an application that is able to compile VCDs and enabling economic operators to submit this information electronically to contracting authorities (Stage 2). Stage 3 includes one of the most critical parts of a VCD which consist of making the evidences contained in a VCD comparable with regard to their contents to enable automated processing and understanding of its contents across borders (stage 3 \u2013 VCD advanced package). Beside this, stage 3 will focus on additional services such as maintaining a VCD or composing a VCD from different economic operators in case of bidding consortia. Stage 4 (VCD networked package) will then provide a sophisticated method for changing the overall process from push to pull. A contracting authority will receive a VCD on the basis of stage 2 and 3 (push) but the documents itself will not be submitted anymore. Instead a contracting authority can request those documents on demand from a database (pull) at national service provider who hosts VCD services, or directly from the very registration authority. The VCD networked package will provide the basis for further developments towards an electronic exchange of evidence. The stages follow a generic approach and may be seen as the evolution or development according to an underlying maturity model. The model as presented in Figure 2 is further described in the following subsection with the purpose to detail the various stages. For a future maturity path of a VCD Service one has to take into consideration the most important points of the vision and the goals of a VCD, which are: Compiling a VCD Package is a service supporting Economic Operators and/or Contracting Authorities in procurement procedures; Future vision means a paradigm shift from handling of documents to the handling of information and the electronic exchange of information in order to establish interoperability on the basis of mutual recognition; The real benefit could be gained when the VCD Package (which may be seen as a container for documents \u2013 structured or unstructured \u2013 and additional information) is complete and accurate.",
        "The following preconditions and assumptions that define the context of VCD Services and VCD Packages should be taken into consideration: Criteria for qualification and selection are in accordance with the Directives 2004/18/EC4,5(public procurement) and 2004/17/EC6 (utilities), and are used to map among national requirements; Attestations give evidence for the fulfilment of one criterion or more criteria; One criterion may require one or more attestations in order to be proved; Documents may be machine readable (digital copies, unstructured contents) or machine interpretable (structured content, thus can be processed by machines); An attestation is made up of one (or more) document(s) including machine interpretable data that describes these attestation (e.g. issuing date); VCD can provide direct access to attestation if there is a mandatory rule for it in law; VCD systems provide single point of contact to attestations from public sources and information necessary to prove conformance to a given call for tender; A VCD Package may be linked to exactly one call for tender thus it is tender specific; A VCD Package may contain self-declarations and several other documents provided by the economic operator; The contracting authority analyses the evidences provided by the economic operator.",
        "In accordance to the above mentioned major visions and requirements two important dimensions are to be considered in order to assess the benefits of a VCD Service and a VCD Package (cf. Figure 3): The Level of support; The Level of completeness. Presenting these two dimensions in a matrix-chart may give an understanding of possible, pragmatic and practical development paths. The level that will be reached by a Member State and the path to go will depend upon the goals and decisions of each single Member State.",
        "The different levels of support address both the maturity of the service and the maturity of the VCD package, where the latter corresponds to the semantic richness of the provided information. On the Peppol/WP2 strategy there is explicit interest to have parallel increments on both sides, assuming that the semantic enrichment of the VCD package requires a corresponding enriched supporting system. This means, the higher the level of support, the higher the interoperability between the Member States (enabled by richer semantics of the information provided in the VCD Package). Information Support: Provides information about criteria and attestations including. Which attestations, certificates or statements provide evidence for which criteria (making up the mapping), including the possibility of using self-declarations; How (i.e. the service) and from whom (e.g. issuing authority) the evidences are provided. Services can be human beings, organisations as well as IT-services. On this level of support the VCD rule set is defined as a reference model which is manually or semiautomatically consulted by the economic operator and/or the contracting authority. There are no VCD Services established which compile, validate or deliver VCD-Packages. Compilation Support: Helps the responsible player (in most cases the economic operator) to compile a VCD Package according to the defined definitions/regulations/rule set/model by means of a specialized VCD Service (not necessarily implying an IT-System):. On this level of support the VCD rule set is defined as a reference model which is manually or semiautomatically consulted by the economic operator and/or the contracting authority. There are no VCD Services established which compile, validate or deliver VCD-Packages. Compilation Support: Helps the responsible player (in most cases the economic operator) to compile a VCD Package according to the defined definitions/regulations/rule set/model by means of a specialized VCD Service (not necessarily implying an IT-System): The evidences included in the VCD Package are digitally represented, yet the contents are not necessarily machine-processable; The individual evidences are enriched with additional descriptions/metadata (adding structural data of evidence); The VCD Package as a whole contains additional metadata, describing the VCD package itself (VCD package data, e.g. compilation date). On this level of support, the VCD Service can deduce from the provided structural metadata, whether the VCD Package is complete or not and if its evidences are valid or outdated. Decision Support: Decision Support enhances the compilation support by processing content- and context-specific data: Evidences are provided in a structured and machine interpretable form, at least those that can be easily transformed in such representation; The contracting authority may control whether or not the evidences prove the required criteria (as opposed to the level of compilation support, where one only could check if the VCD is complete and the attestations are valid). On this level of support, ALL necessary information (structural data of evidence and context specific data) of the included evidences are provided and the contracting authority is able to make a decision about the suitability of the economic operator.",
        "A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested evidences (all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria) are contained in it. The range of evidences varies from self-declarations to official attestations or certificates issued by public authorities (see Figure 7 for a categorization). From a pragmatic point of view, it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of evidences in a first step and to complete the VCD Package later on. It is also reasonable to define a default package list that has to be provided in most public tenders by economic operators independently of particular criteria mentioned by the \u201cCall for Tender\u201d. This would reduce the burden of reading or interpreting the Call for Tender but would increase the need for interpreting other requirements and would not ensure a high level of completeness of a VCD. From these considerations we can derive the following approach: 1. Create a VCD package; 2. Focus on the evidences of criteria according to Articles 45 - 46 in the Directive 2004/18/EC7 first; 3. Create a tender-specific VCD Package through interconnection of VCD and call for tender; 4. Develop possibilities to map and add other documents (self declarations or statements from banks etc.) needed to proof criteria according to Articles 47 - 50 in the Directive 2004/18/EC later on in order to create a complete VCD-Package.",
        "The criteria for qualitative selection and non-exclusion as defined in the Directive 2004/18/EC are the common ground for building a cross border VCD service. The figure below shows the relevant criteria as defined in Articles 45-50 as these are regarded the most common ground when mapping any national criteria to the European ones. Mapping evidences to the criteria stated in Articles 45 and 46 may be regarded as sufficient for a first step since these can be further described within sub criteria and related atomic criteria . The personal situation of a candidate (Article 45) can be for example further described by: Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard to absence of conviction (sec. 45 \u00a71 and \u00a72 (c, d, g)); Atomic criteria: has been convicted by final judgment of the participation in a criminal organisation; Atomic criteria: has been convicted by final judgment of corruption; Atomic criteria: has been convicted by final judgment of money laundering; Atomic criteria: has been convicted of an offence concerning his professional conduct by a judgement which has the force of res judicata. Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard to non-bankruptcy and financial status (sec. 45 \u00a72 (ab)); Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard compliance with fiscal and social obligations (sec. 45 \u00a72 (e-f)). A detailed mapping between those criteria mentioned in Articles 45 and 46 will enable a precise comparison between different tender specific requirements within the Member States enabling wide information support for both, economic operators and contracting authorities The mapping of other criteria (Article 47 to 50) may only be done on a high level (criteria and sub criteria) since these requirements typically differ too much. So there will be basic information and compilation support provided in a first step. Names, contents and qualities of VCD vary between countries, and in many cases economic operators are using the options of Article 51 to add additional up-to-date information from public registries.",
        "National criteria and attestations: The first step delivers information on all the national attestations as well as on where and how to get them; European mapping, economic operator specific: The second step provides a mapping of national attestations which evidence criteria defined by Directive 2004/18/EC8, and with a particular focus on Articles 45 and 46. This is a first move towards cross-border interoperability; Extended European criteria set and mapping: The third step completes the information support by adding all the other criteria in Articles 47 to 50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC on a high level and where possible on sub criteria/atomic criteria level. At this step the economic operators are supported with all the necessary information for participating in cross border tenders. The third step is a minimum requirement to meet for all Member States participating in the PEPPOLVCD- project thus it can be defined as a common goal. It is a precondition to guarantee cross border interoperability. The reason to make this third step as a mandatory requirement to all is that the parties involved will now get a complete picture of all the necessary information (criteria, attestations and ways to get them) and the pilots can work in countries where the mapping has been defined even if there is no pilot existing. The mapping is necessary for a correct system specification and further development according to the overall maturity model enabling improvements with regard to level of support. A Member State may reduce the level of completeness with regard to compilation and decision support with regard to their Pilot, but information support should be provided to all criteria at least on a high level. Beyond the third step, every MS may decide which path to follow and which level to achieve. The path of development provides an idea of how to structure the national VCD project. One may decide to settle for the second level of support, but focus on the most commonly used attestations (a minimum for this level of support). A MS may next decide to stay there (no move), or to complete his service (move to the right) or to keep the narrow focus and head for the highest level of support (move upwards) (cf. Figure 2).",
        "The pre-VCD mapping tool introduces a procedure to collect information about the evidences for specific Call for Tenders. Thereby the Status quo procedure of section 1.2 remains unchanged, except that a pre-VCD mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a European service provider9 (see Figure 5). The mapping tool provides information to the economic operator on which national attestations of his or her country fulfill the criteria set by the procuring agency in the respective country (steps 4, 5). Likewise, the contracting authority can check evidences and authorizations provided by economic operators via the pre-VCD mapping tool (step 9). To fulfill a first precondition for a VCD package as introduced in Stages 2 and beyond, the pre-VCD mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution. It consists of a tool and of a data structure representing different contexts. These contexts are linked to the national public procurement domains and a single European common domain. For every domain we suppose to get a representation of a national index which provides an overview of national criteria demanded in public procurement, and how these are evidenced (i.e. which attestations and/or statements provide what evidence). This index also indicates structural data of evidence for example the issuer of the individual attestations or statements and the service it may activate for public or reserved access. In this respect, the European selection and exclusion criteria, which are derived from the European Directive 2004/18/EC, can be considered the reference criteria, while the national criteria which are the basis for individual public tenders in respective countries are considered the local criteria. Figure 6 depicts the general taxonomy for the pre-VCD mapping concept, while Figure 7 shows a detailed taxonomy of the concept \u201cevidence\u201d. With this taxonomy, it is possible to map the fact that evidences can either be provided by the candidate himself (e.g. self-declaration, declaration on oath, solemn statement) or specific issuers as certified authorities and/or [authorized] third parties. Furthermore, evidences may be of different type such as statements, attestations or certificates, as indicated in Figure 7. Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European exclusion and selection criteria. The respective retrieval of attestations and statements (6) and the subsequent steps (7-8) remain the ones as described in the status-quo description of section 1.2 above.",
        "Stage 1: Stage 1 can be seen as a minimal construction level. It implies the design and rolling out of a tool for supporting the basic interoperability between different legal conditions for providing evidence in public procurement procedures. As stated in the introduction, it can be seen as a minimum requirement for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL VCD work package. At this stage, a semantic model is introduced that supports guidance in applying the relevant community rules on mutual recognition of evidences (e.g. diplomas, certificates or other evidences of formal qualifications) in cross-border procurement procedures. The semantic model especially requires and provides for: a mapping between available national attestations and the selection and exclusion criteria set by the contracting authority through European criteria. These European criteria of selection and exclusion are directly derived from Articles 45-50 of directive 2004/18/EC; a provision of alternative means for evidencing criteria, when foreign economic operators areconsidered; a tool to facilitate identification of evidences needed across countries, and the respective up-todate mappings. The starting point for stage 1 is the mapping of common European criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion to the national criteria and the attestations giving evidence to these criteria. As European criteria are the same for all Member States, they act as the pivot element for the mapping. The semantic model therewith is able to clarify the relationship between national attestations of similar type and the kind of criteria those documents refer to.10 The pre-VCD mapping is implemented through a respective pre-VCD mapping tool, which supports a tendering interaction in the following ways: An economic operator participating in a tender of a foreign country can quite easily understand the requirements (what criteria have to be fulfilled) and decide which are the best national attestations (self declarations included) to prove the criteria requested by the contracting authority; The contracting authority can check through the same mapping mechanism whether the submitted attestations express fulfilment with the relevant criteria or requirements; The contracting authority can activate a direct access to attestations that are exposed through open services, including the international cross-linking. Table 1 provides an overview of the outcome, approach, benefits and necessary efforts or limitations of the pre-VCD mapping.",
        "The use case diagram in Figure 8 shows the main actors and functions of stage 1 (pre-VCD mapping) in the context of a public tender. A contracting authority sends a notification on a Call for Tender to a Publication body that publishes the call. The Call for Tender contains the definition of evidences and the specific criteria on qualitative selection and exclusion that are relevant to this particular call. If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular Call for Tender he can directly retrieve relevant information about evidences and criteria by using the information published in the Call for Tender. In cases below threshold or in the cases where the public notice is partial, the economic operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required information. Having the relevant criteria in place the economic operator will be enabled to get a mapping to the national attestations that refer to those criteria via the pre-VCD mapping tool. Thesame process can be performed by the contracting authority in order to check whether the submitted attestations adequately fulfil certain criteria asked for. The pre-condition to the above flow of events is represented by the formal representation of imposed criteria, in particular for the qualification segments affecting, the technical, the financial and the quality criteria (as per directive 2004/18/EC_Arts. 47-50). Such formal representation has to be addressed along with the setting of the tool. Besides the use of the pre-VCD mapping in actual tendering and procurement procedures, a \u201csystem\u201d needs to be maintained which implements the mapping of European and national laws, and the agreements of mutual recognition among Member States (see use-case diagram depicted in Figure 9).",
        "Major Feature: pre-VCD mapping tool The first feature to be addressed in this stage is the mapping between the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion derived from Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC and the national attestations giving evidence to these criteria. To handle the large set of ruling articles, which may especially vary in the national implementations (articles 47-50), arts 45 and 46 shall get a higher priority for a smooth implementation at first hand, while arts 47 to 50 will only be selectively implemented on the basis of specific and deeper analysis in the PEPPOL pilot contexts. Due to the diversity and variability of evidences according to Art 51, this criterion will receive least priority in the implementations (if at all taken into consideration). This mapping includes at first hand an overview and transparency among national evidences and European criteria as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 above, including information about who issues specific evidence. Further on, this mapping needs to be implemented in the pre-VCD mapping tool as depicted in the use-case diagram in Figure 9, i.e. a list of criteria to be matched is submitted to the entity performing the mapping. Using the underlying technology, the mapping is done and its results, consisting of a list of the attestations giving evidence to the demanded criteria, can be transferred to a requester in case of a public tender. Requirements for the pre-VCD mapping tool The following requirements can be derived for stage 1:",
        "A major precondition for the enforcement of stage 1 is the definition of a standard representation of European criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion. These criteria should be derived directly from 09/11/2009 \u2013 version 1.1 (approved by EC) the Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC in order to ensure employment in Pan-European public procurement procedures. The right granularity and consistency of criteria will be important to ensure legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results. Thus the criteria may have to be iteratively redefined according to the results given by specific mappings. A standard representation of common criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion MUST be defined according to Articles 45-50 of Directive 2004/18/EC; The right granularity and consistency of criteria MUST be found through testing and iterative redefinition in order to ensure legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results; Input will come from the Articles 45-50 of Directive 2004/18/EC.",
        "Superset of evidences: The formal representation will become necessary as a reference data set for the mapping operations showing the relationship between all attestations; Subset of evidences: The input for the current function (mapping) comes from specific \u201cCalls for Tenders\u201d which therewith represent tender-specific requirements.",
        "National requirements of qualitative selection and exclusion for qualitative selection and exclusion have to adequately represent the national legal conditions. They have to be formulated in a way that they can be mapped to common European criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion mentioned by the Articles 45-50. National requirements for qualitative selection and exclusion MUST correspond to the EC criteria given in Article 45-50; National criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion SHOULD have the right granularity and should be consistent among themselves; Input for the current function is taken from the National Public Procurement Acts.",
        "In a first step, all member states do have to establish a mapping of the criteria defined in the relevant EU directive 2004/18/EC to the national attestations giving evidence to these criteria. To ensure a degree of comparability and reliability among the results, the mapping should be based on a common template. For the overall activity it will be important to have the appropriate legal support in order to ensure legitimacy of mappings. A template that ensures comparable and reliable mappings between criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion and national attestations MUST be defined; The members of this work package MUST perform the mapping between national attestations and European criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion; The resulting template has to be computable by machines and readable by humans allowing the assembly of VCD packages through manual and/or automated operations.",
        "In order to achieve trust and an agreement on the mutual recognition of qualification documents as demanded in the directive, all artefacts and mapping results that relate to the mapping of evidence have to be approved from a legal point of view. Compliances to national and European conditions must be ensured in particular for the definition of a standard representation of common criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion, the definition of a mapping template and the mapping between national attestations and the common criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion. Legitimacy of standard representation of common criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion MUST be ensured; Legitimacy of standard mapping template MUST be ensured; Legitimacy of mapping between national attestations and common criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion MUST be ensured.",
        "Contracting authorities approaching the tool have to assess the compatibility of the \u201cmapping template\u201d with their inspection procedures and code of practice.",
        "The mapping rules require formal approval and adoption by the National Bodies governing the public procurement activity; The European Commission as well as the National Bodies have to update the mapping model in case the legal grounds change or the mapping of European Criteria to national Evidences and issuing bodies change; Hence, adoption and approval procedures have to be defined and enacted in order to install the pre-VCD mapping and pre-VCD mapping tool as an official mapping model; Precondition: The adoption of the model requires a parallel effort from the legal side to compare whether the provisions of existing NPPAs can get a harmonization through the referencing to the EU directive. This is a major requirement to drive the action of contracting authorities that have strict obligations to follow while performing in a tendering procedure.",
        "The commonly approved national mappings have to be made accessible to the different stakeholders as especially economic operators, contracting authorities and national VCD service providers. For that purpose, a basic infrastructure or system architecture or a mapping facility has to be defined. The mapping facility, independent of how such as \u201csystem\u201d is actually implemented, has to provide the services with regard to the pre-VCD mapping tool Centralized or decentralized infrastructure? Will there be one centralized system on a European level hosting and providing the mapping or a decentralized system consisting of interconnected national systems? In the latter case, one could define that each national system only hosts the national mapping or that each one hosts all the different national mappings which would make a synchronization of the different systems necessary. A decision to deploy either a centralised or a decentralized infrastructure that provides the mapping service MUST be made; By which technical means will the mapping be provided? The technical means to provide the mapping service has to be defined in dependence on the choice of the pilot solution. The simplest form without any technical support could for example consist in the one-time distribution of mapping tables in paper-based form. Another solution could consist of a web-based access to a system providing the mapping by querying an underlying database which contains the mapping table. A more advanced solution would be an automated processing of the mapping according to the relevant criteria that therefore have to be specified by the contracting authority in a dedicated electronic format. Also the higher maturity levels defined in this vision (stage 2-4) can use the mapping service in order to retrieve the mapping information. It MUST be defined by which technical means the mapping service will be provided. Which entity will host the mapping facility? In dependence of the choice of infrastructures (centralised \u2013 decentralized) and the organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping facility it has to be defined who will be responsible to host the mapping facility. An entity that hosts the mapping facility MUST be defined in dependence of the type of infrastructure and the dedicated governing model.",
        "A governing model has to be defined in order to deploy the infrastructure, to maintain its state and sustainability over time. In this respect the composition, structure and scope of the governing model has to be formally defined to ensure fulfilment of functions like liability, sustainability and maintainability. The dedicated governing model should have the necessary status and power to govern its assigned functions. A governing model with the necessary status and power MUST be formally defined in order to ensure fulfilment of functions like liability, sustainability and maintainability. Liability: In law a legal liability is a situation in which a person or organisation is financially and legally responsible. The liability of the organisation that governs infrastructure and mapping facility has to be defined in order to ensure trust into the system and particular mapping results?; The Liability of organisation that governs the infrastructure and mapping facility MUST be defined; Sustainability: Sustainability is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state into the future. The governing model must ensure that the state of the mapping system will be kept over time. Therefore the mapping system has to be based on the commonly agreed mapping and no changes are allowed without a common agreement; The mapping facility MUST ensure sustainability of the system over time based on commonly agreed mapping schemes; Maintainability: The mapping has to be easily maintainable which could be of interest in the case of changes of the legal basis on national or European level. A formal procedure has to be found how changes are applied to the system. Moreover an organisation or institution that governs the process of change management has to be defined; A formal procedure to make changes to the system MUST be defined.",
        "Stage 1 is the key concept for ensuring interoperability between the different national systems of evidence provision in public procurement procedures. Every higher stage will be depended on the mapping model defined in this stage. Thus this stage will ensure the integration of different stages and interoperability as such. Therefore each national service provider that provides a VCD (stage 2-4) and all relevant key other stakeholder such as economic operators, contracting authorities and certifiers must be able to retrieve the latest mapping information from the mapping facility. The mapping facility MUST be accessible to all relevant key stakeholders such as economic operators, contracting authorities, certifiers and national service providers.",
        "In order to derive sufficient mapping information the economic operator has to provide the criteria that are relevant to a particular call for tender. The overall procedure would be simplified dramatically when the relevant criteria for a particular call for tender could be fetched either from a publication body or directly from the contracting authority. The interaction with either the publication body or the communication with the contracting authority therefore has to be further defined. The interaction between mapping facility and Publication Body / Contracting Authority SHOULD be defined in order to simplify the procedure to retrieve the relevant criteria for a particular Call for Tender.",
        "Attention has to be paid to a number of requirements such as reliability, accessibility, usability, maintenance, authenticity, actuality, compliance of mapping to laws and national structures, etc. The pre-VCD mapping tool has to be accredited by the European Union and the Member States. A number of functionalities of the mapping tool are: Provision of an update mechanism maintained by the individual Member State; The pre-VCD mapping tool is openly accessible for economic operators and contracting authorities etc; The tool interface is available in the official languages of the European Union; A powerful search mechanism is implemented to deliver good results when economic operators query the pre-VCD mapping tool in order to understand what evidences he can deliver to confer to the selection and exclusion criteria set in a public tender in another Member State; The results are delivered in a format simple to use for the economic operators; e.g. a check list of evidences he can collect from respective issuing bodies in his country, which fulfil the selection criteria and prove the non-conformance with exclusion criteria set by the contracting authority from a different Member State. Besides such functionalities of the tool, some general requirements regarding the operation of the pre- VCD mapping tool have to be implemented: The Member States shall agree on a common representation format for the information they intend to supply into the knowledge base supporting the tool\u2019s operations; The Member States shall supply the information generated from the analysis of the national context they represent; The Member States need to update the mapping in case of any change within a short time frame (e.g. five days after a legal change has been put into force); The European service provider for the pre-VCD mapping tool has to ensure that European legal changes are implemented quickly (e.g. within five days after enforcement); The European service provider takes responsibility of the operative implementation and compliance of the mapping model implemented in the pre-VCD mapping tool with the respective European and national conditions. Hence, it must be established and funded with clearly defined responsibilities for maintenance and conformance assessment between national solutions; The European service provider sets up a formal definition of the tool generated results; The European service provider defines the criteria for a \u201cservice contract\u201d to be formally agreed with \u201cusers\u201d.",
        "The pre-VCD mapping is the prerequisite for the VCD packages described in the subsequent stages. It requires that the European criteria and national criteria have to be elaborated and agreed upon by the different Member States. The major advantage and benefits of stage 1 are as follows: The major benefit for economic operators lies in the fact that an automatic mapping of criteria to national evidences is provided through a pre-VCD mapping tool, thus omitting the need for a manual and error-prone selection of appropriate evidences for a particular Call for Tender. The mapping guarantees that the submitted attestations are mutually recognized if they correspond to the mapping information given by the system. The mutual recognition implies a formal commitment by contracting authorities that take part of the service chain, or alternatively by a legal enforcement operated by qualified entities. The formal commitment must in turn specify what is taken as pure guidance or qualified template; The contracting authority can as well use the mapping in order to check if the attestations handed in by an economic operator of another country are sufficiently evidencing those selection and exclusion criteria defined for the tender; Through the pre-VCD mapping model, it will also be possible to identify the major issuing bodies of particular evidence. Nevertheless this function will not be available for all kinds of attestation since there may be too many issuing bodies that provide attestations of the same type (e.g. for criteria to prove the economic standing of a candidate or economic operator); Through the pre-VCD mapping tool, both the economic operator and the contracting authority save time and money because they need not to find out by themselves; how the attestations and statements existing in the economic operator\u2019s country can fulfill the criteria demanded by the procuring agency of another country; how the attestations and statements provided by the economic operators of different countries fulfill the criteria demanded in the contracting authority\u2019s tender. Through the pre-VCD mapping and pre-VCD mapping tool, higher transparency and better information quality is provided for both of the actors, economic operator and economic operator). Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European exclusion and selection criteria.",
        "As mentioned in the vision statement, this stage focuses on the preconditions for a VCD package, and hence provides only limited functionality. A mapping system is introduced, allowing the mapping of criteria to national evidences, thus omitting cumbersome manual and potentially error-prone selection of attestations/evidences by the economic operator across borders. The following statements describe the limitations of this stage, i.e. the functions that are not covered by this stage: The economic operator is not supported in retrieving and collecting the required attestations from the appropriate bodies; A translation of the documents is not provided. All documents to be transferred to a foreign contracting authority still have to be translated by a certified translator into the appropriate target language, if requested by the contracting authority; In this stage the economic operator is not supported in creating a VCD package that follows a common logic. The VCD package compilation has to be performed by the economic operator himself (it is offered in the next stage of the VCD four-stage-model); There is a quality issue to be addressed concerning the acquisition of data for the knowledge base, i.e. the data supporting the operations of the tool. Qualified input sources are temporarily defined and approved within a close group of stakeholders. The following statements reflect assumptions made for stage 1 and dependencies with other stages: Every higher stage depends on the mapping model defined in the pre-VCD mapping stage. Thus this stage will ensure the integration of different stages and semantic interoperability in terms of mutual recognition; The contracting authority and economic operator can only retrieve information about the issuing bodies of particular evidences when a Member State has specified accredited public issuing bodies and recognized private issuing bodies within the national part of the pre-VCD mapping; Existing national procedures and infrastructures in requesting, issuing, exchanging, collecting, assembling, proving and submitting evidences are applied and remain unchanged.",
        "Stage 2 requires the establishment of a national VCD service provider which hosts the VCD system in order to provide economic operators with the services necessary to create an early VCD package. Thus, in stage 2, the concept of a VCD package is introduced. The national VCD service provider operates the VCD system and takes the role of a trusted third party (TTP) whose services can be partially trusted by contracting authorities. The VCD package relies on a set of automated, semiautomated and manual issuing services which are collected by the VCD system. Thereby issuing services that are automated through a direct access to national issuing bodies are reliable to the contracting authority while manual and semi-automated issuing service that have to be provided by the economic operator are not under control of the national VCD service provider. The VCD system wants to ensure completeness of a VCD package by acting as a single-point of contact for the economic operator that supports him in creating a VCD package from various sources. The VCD system in stage 2 will be capable to compile a VCD package from different types of data. Stage 2 defines the basic structure of a VCD package by including these types of data that give evidence for the suitability of an economic operator. Therewith the contracting authority will be enabled to check the validity of the evidences contained within the VCD and whether the requested evidence adequately represents the fulfilment of the demanded criteria. Thereby translation of evidences may be still necessary and has to be performed by the economic operator in dependence on national legal and organizational requirements because the VCD package does not provide any standardised context-specific data which provide common semantics. Checks concerning the content of the evidences are therewith not possible in this stage, as there is no context specific data available. Nevertheless a VCD simple package provides a set of other types of data that are introduced in the list below: Structural VCD package data: Data that describes the VCD-Package as a whole, e.g. VCD Unique Identifier, VCD issuing time, VCD service provider etc; Tender specific evidence: Data that describe tender specific aspects e.g. TED id of the tender, criteria fulfilled by the evidence contained etc; Economic operator evidence: Data describing the individual situation of the economic operator e.g. name of economic operator, commercial register number, VAT number, etc; Structural data of evidence: Data generically describing evidence on a level detached from the semantic of its content e.g. DocName, DocLanguage, DocIssue date, DocExpiration date etc; Evidences: Attestations and candidate statements in form of files included in the VCD package e.g. excerpts from the commercial register, criminal records, self-declarations etc; Translations: Translations of attestations included within the VCD e.g. official translation of the excerpt from the commercial register, translation of criminal record etc. The types of data listed above have to be defined and agreed by the members of this work package in order to create a common structure of a VCD package. Furthermore the VCD package needs to provide the ability to be human readable thus a VCD viewing system is introduced in this stage too. In order to enable the economic operator to send the VCD simple package to any contracting authority stage 2 introduces the VCD transportation system which is strongly connected to the PEPPOL infrastructure proposed by WP8. The implementation of interfaces to tendering platforms, which typically should be capable to receive VCD packages, therefore should be encouraged. All activities above need to be adequately monitored through identity and access management since a lot of sensitive data is exchanged between the actors involved, thus stage 2 defines major requirements in this context.",
        "The use case description of stage 2 contains several sub-diagrams that describe interactions that are needed firstly to authenticate to the systems and secondly to create, transport and view a VCD simple package. Figure 10 contains a general overview of the following systems and actors affected within the use case VCD simple package of stage 2 (VCD simple package): Identity and access management: Economic operator; Officer,; VCD system: Economic operator, Issuing body; VCD transportation system: Economic operator, Contracting authority; VCD translations system: Translator; VCD viewing system: Economic Operator, Contracting authority. It is important to emphasize that the systems described by the use case diagrams are systems that are logically different but not necessarily physically different. For example the VCD viewing system and the VCD system may be implemented as a single physical unit; they are logically different as shown in the use case diagram below. In contrast, if there are physically different systems a singlesign- on functionality should be used in order to increase the usability of the connected systems for the user. For example the logical systems identity and access management is strongly connected to the VCD system, to the VCD viewing system and the VCD transportation system and in particular refers to PEPPOL infrastructure proposed by WP8 and to already existing infrastructures within the Member States. In order to increase the overall usability for the actors, a single-sign-on should be implemented in order to connect authentication among different systems affected by identity and access management. Members that do already have system in place (e.g. for identity and access management) should utilize these infrastructures in order to lower the implementation efforts and to increase the acceptance among stakeholders affected by these systems. Thus the systems below do not require to be implemented in a uniform manner and several implementation variations may be possible. The use case VCD package is affected by four different systems. The overall pre-condition to access the VCD system is that the Economic Operator has previously been authenticated so that the VCD system can check appropriate user rights within identity and access management. Identity and access management is required to be done externally in a manual process that will verify the requestor\u2019s identity before providing user rights and access. The VCD system itself involves two major actors. Economic operators act as requestors by authenticating to the VCD system, creating/recompiling a VCD simple package and retrieving this package from the VCD system. In contrast issuing bodies provide evidences to the system. Most Member States require that evidences are provided in the target language, thus a translator may have to translate evidences within the external VCD translation system. The VCD transportation system is used to submit the VCD to the contracting authorities. Contracting authorities can then authenticate and use the VCD viewing system to access and view the VCD package.",
        "The Identity and access management is an official procedure that handles roles for authorisation external to the VCD system and involves three actors, the economic operator, an officer and the VCD system itself as shown in Figure 11. Economic operators have to apply for a VCD account and therefore they have to provide sensitive economic operator data (for example by uploading attestations to verify these data). Sensitive economic operator data must initially be provided by an economic operator (e.g. company registration number, VAT number, social insurance number of the company etc.) in order to create an account and to start any VCD packaging service. An officer has to verify whether the provided data belongs to the economic operator and has to assure its correctness because either the VCD packaging service would not work or would deliver incomplete or wrong results. After verification the officer creates a VCD account where sufficient data about the economic operator is stored. In addition, identity and access management requires the possibility to delete an account within the VCD system and an official procedure to apply for a modification of the VCD account. An economic operator can authenticate to the VCD system only when the economic operator has sufficient user rights (e.g. authorized representative of economic operator) provided by identity and access management as shown in Figure 12.",
        "After authentication the economic operator can provide further tender specific data to the VCD system (e.g. TED ID) in order to start the creation of a VCD simple package. The VCD system creates a suggestion for compilation according to the results provided by the pre-VCD mapping tool and in turn the economic operator can edit and confirm the compilation suggestion that is given by the VCD system as shown in Figure 13. The function of creating a VCD package includes the collection of evidence (including translations) and structural evidence data through several sources. Evidence and structural evidence data is provided by issuing bodies which can submit evidence and structural evidence data to the VCD system via an interface. An important remark therefore is that economic operators can take the role of an issuing body by submitting for example candidate statements, manually collected evidence or translations of evidence. The interface to submit evidence is defined through a service definition that allows adding specific structural evidence data that belongs to that evidence. The collection of evidence is finalized when all required evidences are submitted and this requires waiting for those evidences that have to be provided manually or semi-automatically. The VCD system can now compile the VCD package and creates a set of structural VCD package data that belong to the compilation process.",
        "The economic operator can submit the VCD simple package to the contraction authority by using the VCD transportation system which is part of the PEPPOL infrastructure. For using the VCD transportation system of WP8, both economic operators and contracting authorities have to authenticate to have access. An important remark hereby is the usage of procurement platforms where bids are typically uploaded according to a given Call for Tender. The transportation system of WP8 used by the VCD should be able to provide a possibility to send the VCD package directly to the contracting authority either by utilizing the upload functionality of a procurement platform or by directly sending the VCD to the contracting authority by using other means provided by the transportation system or typically used by the contracting authority. It is also important to state that the transportation system does not necessarily have to be used by the economic operator. The economic operator receives a VCD package by the VCD system and it is up to his choice how to submit the VCD package to the contracting authority.",
        "After retrieving the VCD package from economic operators, contracting authorities may have to authenticate to the VCD viewing system in order to view the VCD package. In contrast economic operators do not have to authenticate to the VCD viewing system because they are taking the role of an owner of the VCD package. The VCD viewing system has to fulfil certain sub-functionalities for displaying the different kinds of data that are contained within a VCD package. In stage 2 the viewing system should provide the possibility to view the following types of data (see Figure 14): Structural VCD package data (e.g. the creation date of the VCD),; Tender specific evidence (e.g. the TED ID to which the VCD package is related to),; Economic operator data (e.g. name of an Economic Operator),; Structural data of evidence (e.g. document name); The evidences (e.g. criminal record); A translation of the evidences (e.g. certified translation of a criminal record). At this stage, the semantic model is enhanced through structural VCD package data, economic operator data, tender specific data and structural data of evidence. 09/11/2009 \u2013 version 1.1 (approved by EC) The structural VCD package data describes the package (e.g. VCD issuer, VCD issuing time, schema version etc.) and is provided by the VCD service provider. Economic operator data is data that can initially be provided by an economic operator (e.g. company registration number, VAT number, social insurance number of the company etc.) to start the VCD packaging service. We suggest that the provision of economic operator data for economic operators that represent a consortium will be covered in stage 3. Economic operator data is the information needed to start the process and the economic operator thereby has to assure the correctness of its data because either the packaging service would not work or would deliver incomplete results. There needs to be a specific registration procedure where an economic operator provides economic operator data to the VCD service provider in order to create an account. The VCD service provider then creates an account for the economic operator where sufficient economic operator data is stored in order to retrieve attestations. An official procedure has to be defined to change this economic operator data to ensure updated economic operator data. In contrast tender specific data provides data that is connected to a specific Call for Tender (e.g. TED id of the tender, Subset of criteria etc.) comes either from another system (e.g. TED) or has to be provided manually by the economic operator. Structural data of evidences describes attestations on a level detached of the semantic of its content itself (e.g. ItemName, DocName, DocTitle, DocLanguage, DocFormat, DocID, DocIssue date, DocExpiration date)",

        "Table 3 shows the additional benefits of stage 2 (first stage in four-stage VCD concept containing documents):",
        "The major aim of stage 2 is to draft logical systems that enable economic operators to create simple VCD packages and to submit them to contracting authorities. Thereby stage 2 focuses on the necessary different logical systems that either provide major functionalities with regard to creating and viewing a VCD packages (VCD system) or which support the entire process such as authentication (Identity and Access management), transportation (VCD transportations system) or translation (VCD translation system). The general assumption of stage 2 is that the former pre-VCD mapping tool (stage 1) will be utilized as a module that is adequately integrated into the VCD system. Stage 2 also introduces the idea of a national VCD service provider which operates the different services necessary to create and view a VCD package. The national VCD service provider will provide a single-point of access to several attestations and issuing services that are electronically available. Nevertheless it will be necessary to include other evidences that have to be provided semiautomatically or manually by the economic operator. It also cannot be guaranteed that each evidentiary document required according to the criteria stated in the Call for Tender by the contracting authority can be pointed at with a particular mapping results of the pre-VCD mapping tool since some evidence diverge too much in their contents and scope. In those cases the VCD system will provide the possibility to add those documents into the VCD simple package through placeholders which may 09/11/2009 \u2013 version 1.1 (approved by EC) have a very generic grounding for mapping defined through an abstract class of documents (e.g. evidence with regards to environmental management standards). When summarizing those points it can be generally stated that a VCD at stage 2 and beyond still relies on several manual processes that have to be generated by the economic operator and which cannot be automated in short or medium term. However, a reduced scope of a VCD is necessary in order to provide the possibility to submit a VCD that has a sufficient level of completeness. Another aim of stage 2 is to differentiate, define and structure the types of data that will constitute a VCD package. Stage 2 does not focus on the re-development of existing evidentiary documents but on their extension through a common standard representation within a VCD. The VCD package contains similar structural fields which likewise describe the evidences contained in it in similar manner, order and style. Having similar structural layout of a VCD it will be easier to understand the contents of it and potentially to translated those structural key information from the language of the issuer or economic to the language of the contracting authority. Nevertheless a translation of the contents of evidentiary documents is not focussed at in this stage and has to be provided manually by the economic operator through adding translations into the VCD simple package. Stage 2 lays the ground for the further development of a VCD package towards an advanced package within stages 3. The VCD package only focus on major functions that are necessary to create such a package and doesn\u2019t make use of other service that are introduced in the subsequent phases such as, recompiling an existing VCD package, usage of context-specific data and merging VCD packages of different economic operators into a single one. The recompilation of existing VCD packages increases the maintainability of a VCD for the economic operator by for example indicating which evidence has to be replaced by a new one and which evidence has to be additionally provided in case preparing a bid for a different Call for Tender. The usage of context-specific data thereby is an important precondition since these data can provide real-time information about the status of contents of the VCD which is needed in terms of making update proposals. Also the merging of different VCD packages into a single unit to be used when consortia which prepare a bid as a multi-party group is not addressed in stage 2.",
        "Stage 3 represents a further step towards an optimised support for economic operators and contracting authorities. It is based on the features and functionalities of stage 2 and adds additional main features: recompiling an already existing VCD package; merging data of several consortium members into one VCD package; embedding of context-specific data. With regard to the idea of increasing the \u201clevel of support\u201d for the actors (as explained in the introduction chapter) it is clear that the functionalities \"Merging\" and \"Recompiling\" enhance the capability of a VCD system of stage 2 in terms of compilation support while the new functionality \"Embedding context specific data\" is a tremendous improvement in terms of decision support. Recompiling an already existing VCD package Recompilation services provide functionalities that enable the reuse of evidences as well as their additional data of already existing VCD packages. This functionality is useful for several reasons: Updating an existing VCD package whenever one or more evidences are outdated. This could be done by checking whether evidences are outdated or not, retrieving the outdated evidences again and creating a new VCD package, which then contains the newly obtained evidences and those evidences from the original VCD, which are still valid; Creating a new VCD package on the base of an already existing VCD package of the same economic operator for a different tender. Merging data of several consortium members into one VCD package Stage 2 concentrates on cases with a \"single legal entity\" as the economic operator. For more complex constructions like consortiums, syndicate, joint ventures, contractor-subcontractorrelationships and so on, a merged VCD would be sufficient. Stage 3 introduces the functionality of providing a single VCD package for the economic operator regardless of whether the economic operator is a \"single legal entity\" or consists of several legal entities like a consortium, syndicate or joint venture. To create a single VCD package for consortia requires that additional information has to be provided by the economic operator: based on the fact whether a consortium partner acts in the form of a subcontractor for a very specialised task or as a partner having equal rights a different set of evidences might have to be provided for every partner/subcontractor. Embedding of context specific data Stage 2 delivers a VCD package containing required evidences as well as different kinds of data such as structural metadata, economic operator data or structural VCD package data. Stage 3 enhances the level of support (as explained in the introduction chapter) and offers decision support describing the major content of an evidence through context-specific data. This gives additional support to the contracting authority when deciding whether an economic operator is suitable or not. This happens by adding context specific data i.e. relevant data extracted from the provided evidences. The context specific data is provided by an issuing body through an interface in a machine interpretable form and displayed in a way the contracting authority (and the economic operator as well, of course) can see. This should happen by exposing the most relevant key information of a given evidence at one glance. In most cases the contracting authority does not have to view the delivered evidence in every detail to come to a decision. As context specific data follows a common and agreed schema, translation of evidences might by unnecessary. Generally speaking, we may say that the behaviour of contracting authorities cannot be driven or altered by the service solutions released by PEPPOL, so the checking strategy is part of their undisputable decision, nonetheless every newly added feature aiming at the simplification of their duties can really be welcomed. When the context specific data cannot be provided by an issuing services in a machine interpretable form, there might be the necessity of contributions from the economic operator to complete context specific data or even the national VCD service providers who acts as intermediary (e.g. Trusted Third Party) and may approve those data (scope of stage 4). If the national VCD service provider takes the role of a Trusted Third Party who approves context specific data this will effect the cooperation and requires a specific management under a trust and liability schema. At this stage the VCD service of stage 2 is enhanced by additional functionality (\"Merging\" and \"Recompiling\"). The compiled VCD package contains the digital copy of evidences (possibly in various formats) and structural data of evidences as in stage 2. But at the same stage the VCD service could offer additional support (decision support by embedding context specific data) that means a VCD package could contain the digital copy of evidences (possibly in various formats) and structural data of evidences as in stage 2 augmented by context specific data. So it has to be carefully elaborated what kind of additional functionality or support should be implemented and what will be the scope of context specific data in terms of a VCD package. Table 4 gives a summary of introduced features by the current VCD Stage 3.",

        "The stage 2-collection process for evidence and structural evidence data has to be extended to include the collection and processing of context specific data. It is important to understand that context specific data cannot be automatically extracted from unstructured data as scanned copies or text documents as this could lead to incorrect results due to the non-deterministic behaviours of such extraction mechanisms (OCR, etc). Valid deterministic approaches of providing (obtaining) context specific data are: Automated context specific data provision: extraction of data from structured evidence artefacts which are machine interpretable (e.g. XML) and which have been generated by an IT-system, if the structure is consistent with an agreed upon schema; Semi-automated context specific data provision: data is provided by a human being of the issuing service by filling in values in a structured, pre-defined template. This template can be a web-form, an XML-file consistent with an agreed upon XML-scheme, or other structured data sheets. The availability of an adequate user interface for providing the data values is an important issue of this approach; Manual context specific data provision: data is provided by the issuing services in any unstructured format (e.g. scanned copies, text documents). A human being of the national VCD service provider manually extracts the data and provides it to the system using the mechanisms described in \u201cSemi-automated context specific data provision\u201d. This approach requires an additional level of trust into the national VCD service provider acting as Trusted Third party as he will be responsible for the correctness of the context specific data itself and not just only for the compliance of the processes, which are executed by the VCD services.",

        "A major feature of a stage 3 VCD advanced package is the introduction of context specific data. These data fields are specified in an agreed upon data schema and describe the content of an evidence or parts of its content under a predefined selection schema. The benefit of using context specific data is to avoid the necessity to read through the original version or a translated version of an evidence in order to obtain the information which is necessary to decide, whether a criterion is satisfied or not and thereby having a structured overview of the important key data or information of the evidences contained in a VCD. This overview \u2013 the data representation \u2013 can be implemented either language independent or in multiple languages, so there is no need to translate the evidence any more if it is sufficiently described through context specific data. The enhanced and automated documents\u2019 readability that comes from the context specific data must be compared to the local legal provisions and document checking practice adopted by contracting authorities. Whether to use context specific data as substitute of a certified translation of an evidences or as decision support belongs to the contracting authority\u2019s decision. Requirements: context specific data A VCD system MUST provide functionality to collect and process context specific data for evidence that has to be provided manually or semi-automatically by the issuing body, by the economic operator or any trusted third party; A VCD system MUST provide functionality to collect and process context specific data for evidence that has to be provided automatically by the issuing body; A VCD system MUST provide IT-interfaces to issuing bodies which provide evidences in machine interpretable format; A VCD system MUST interact with the issuing bodies which provide evidences in machine interpretable format through IT-interfaces; A VCD system MUST provide a user interface to the issuing body to provide context specific data for an evidence in a structured form (e.g. web-interface, XML-file-upload); The VCD system MUST provide a functionality to validate the provided context specific data during the submission process of context specific data to ensure the data is consistent with the VCD advanced package schema; Interfaces MUST be defined to retrieve context specific data from issuing bodies either automatically or semi-automatically; Interfaces SHOULD be defined that enable national VCD service providers to approve context specific data if they decide to take the role of a trusted third party; The rule set derived from legal requirements concerning \u201cevidence checking\u201d MUST be defined; he rule set allowing for a Stage 3 mapping among concepts expressed by the \u201ccontext specific data\u201d MUST be defined; The rule set derived from legal requirements concerning subcontracting and other consortium constellations MUST be defined; A functionality to display context specific data SHOULD/MUST be included within any VCD. Quality attributes: context specific data Any VCD advanced package MUST follow a common standard schema of context specific data that summarize and structure major information contained within context specific evidences; Context specific data MUST be machine interpretable; Evidences that have a simple structure and limited variety of contents MUST be included into the common standard schema first; WP2 SHOULD provide easy solutions for transforming the contents of context specific evidence into simple context specific representations (e.g. a Balance sheet can have several values but an easy representation could be the fulfilment of certain ranges for example below 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / \u2026); A semantic definition of each element/class of the common standard schema of context specific data MUST be created and has to ensure a common understanding; A semantic definition of each element/class of the common standard schema of context specific data MUST ensure that these data is mutually recognized as replacement of the official translation of an evidences included; A method and agreement procedure to develop a common standard schema of context specific data MUST be defined. This procedure must cover the technical aspects of data analysis (e.g. reverse engineering) as well as the organizational aspects (e.g. which context specific data is required from contracting authorities or under which circumstances would they would replace certified translation of evidence by context specific data); Any common standard schema of context specific data classes MUST be agreed upon the pilot partners; Representation of context specific data SHOULD be available in multiple languages; Every pilot partner MUST follow the common standard schema of context specific data by defining a national version of it; A method for versioning the development of common standard schema of context specific data SHOULD be found.",
        "The VCD creation service of stage 2 VCD simple package has to be improved in order to include the functionalities for considering context specific data and VCD merging. Requirements: Advanced VCD creation service A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to initiate the creation of a VCD advanced package; A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to provide existing VCD packages of other economic operators when specific disclosure options have been activated; A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to check, whet her the structural VCD package data of existing VCD packages of other economic operators are consistent with the VCD advanced package schema of other economic operators, or not; A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to check, whether the tender specific data of existing VCD packages are consistent with the tender specific data of other VCD packages; A VCD system MUST provide functionality to merge the following data from several existing VCD packages of other economic operators:; Structural VCD package data; Structural data of evidence; Tender specific data; Economic operator data; Context specific data; Evidence; Authorized translation of evidence. A VCD system MUST provide functionality to compile the data which result from the evidence collection process and the data provided by the economic operator in the VCD advanced package creation. The types of data which have to be compiled into a VCD advanced package are therefore:; Structural VCD package data; Structural data of evidence; Tender specific data; Economic operator data; Context specific data; Evidence; Authorized translation of evidence. Quality attributes: Advanced VCD creation service Merging of VCD simple packages and VCD advanced packages into a VCD advanced package SHOULD be possible.",
        "In stage 3, the functionality of the VCD system has to be extended in order to provide a VCD recompilation functionality. Re-compiling a VCD package means using evidence data from an existing VCD package, validating which of the evidences are outdated, retrieving actual versions of the outdated evidences an creating a new VCD package which contains the not-outdated evidences from the original VCD package and the newly obtained evidences. The re-compilation process considers only those evidences which are necessary in be compliant to the criteria which have to be addressed in the new VCD package. The re-compilation can be invoked to re-compile a VCD package for a different Tender. Requirements: VCD re-compilation service A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator to initiate the recompilation of an existing VCD package into a VCD advanced package; A VCD system MUST provide a user-interface to the economic operator for uploading an existing VCD package; A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to decompose an existing VCD package; A VCD system MUST provide a functionality to identify outdated or obsolete evidences; A VCD system must provide a functionality to retrieve actual instances of outdated evidences.

        "Stage 3 will include the features depicted in chapter 2.4.3. Providing context specific data leads to an additional support for the economic operator and for the contracting authority addressing the need to evaluate the contents of evidences across borders. An economic operator is able to verify the correctness of the provided context specific data. The contracting authority in turn can check the suitability of an Economic Operator by having a sufficient summary of the contents of a VCD in the required language. The provision of context specific data avoids the need for translating certain evidences that are available in electronic format and allow the description of its contents using the common standard schema of context specific data. This approach follows again the idea to ensure the completeness of the VCD on the one hand and the level of support on the other hand by stepwise including more electronic evidences to the VCD. An important point to ensure the acceptance of this approach is to establish or expand the trust in national VCD services cross borders: In stage 1 contracting authorities are required to trust the provided evidences, issuing bodies, translators and the correctness of the international mapping; In stage 2 contracting authorities are required to trust the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing valid (not outdated) evidences or other evidences which are suitable to give evidence for the required criteria; In stage 3 contracting authorities are required to expand their trust into the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing context specific data which augment the evidence content. On the side of the VCD service providers, composing a VCD package is a more or less complex task depending on national country abilities, willingness, etc. Stage 3 as a concept does not predetermine a solution where all evidences are provided electronically in machine interpretable form. Therefore stage 3 is flexible enough to be implemented in countries where issuing bodies provide their evidences either in paper form, as scanned copies, as unstructured electronic documents or as fully structured electronic documents. One key requirement is the definition of a common schema of context specific data out of given evidences through reverse engineering methods and to agree on such a definition. The definition of national occurrences of the context specific schema has to be done by each member state on its own. One limitation which will be faced in the specification phase of the current project will be that it is unlikely, that a common and agreed upon standard schema of context specific data should be established across context specific networks (e.g. Business Registers). Thus the long term goal should be the development of this unified set of context specific data which is necessary to provide all the information a contracting authority wants to get out of evidences. One reasonable way to achieve this goal is to put this work on the agenda of context specific networks (e.g. BRITE, ECRIS) and standardisation organisations (e.g. CEN). Nevertheless, WP2 would like approve whether it is possible to use simplified representations of evidences expressed as context specific data to provide a unified representation of major contents. If a specific criminal record for example does not have any entry inside it can be represented in context specific format by having a code-list saying \u201cnothing or no entry\u201d. Another example could be for example a Balance sheet which can have several different values but an easy representation could only be expressed through definition of certain ranges e.g. below 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / etc. In any case the usage of context specific data cannot prevent and exclude specific needs from contracting authorities that may require concurrence of both, the original evidence including certified translation and context specific data. The behaviour cannot be influenced since it is dependent on national requirements and legislation but the provision of context specific data within the VCD may lead to a change of current practices across borders.",
        "Stage 4 introduces a set of ideas and possibilities how further value can be added to a Virtual Company Dossier. The key idea of Stage 4 is to create a network for the VCD that allows retrieving attestations in a more flexible way. Potentially a direct exchange from trusted attestation services to contracting authorities could therefore be implemented. The Virtual Company Dossier than consists of some references to attestation services which mandate a contracting authority to obtain information directly. A direct exchange between trusted attestation services and a contracting authority would provide many opportunities with regard to an increase of the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction costs of the parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD. Nevertheless such direct exchange is very difficult to implement technically because a lot of entities and attestation services have to be federated. This raises costs and other technical questions such as access policies to trusted attestation services and therewith also legal uncertainties such as data privacy, data security and data protection. Also from a political point of view there might be several objections to give a direct access to source registers and issuing bodies. Finally a semantic pre-condition would be that evidence is provided in a common electronic format that allows an automated transformation into the requestor\u2019s target language. Such a solution would then be also depended on mutually recognized, contextspecific data formats provided by some specific networks such as BRITE or ECRIS (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2008). In order to avoid some of the above mentioned complexity we propose some first steps that might help to combine the ideas of a VCD and a federated network in medium term allowing further improvements of a VCD. To avoid political and technical questions with regard to federated networks, the access to attestations services should be done indirectly through the national VCD service provider. We suggest that a national VCD service provider uses a temporary storage to hold the attestations instead of compiling them directly into a VCD. The VCD then only consists of a number of flags that denote an evidence as well as structural data of evidence and context specific data plus a reference to retrieve the attestation on demand at the time of awarding. Therefore it would be important that the evidence requested is valid at the time of awarding or when the call for tender is closed. Also mechanism for maintenance of evidence could potentially be implemented in order to keep the information up to date. Such model of indirect exchange would also make it easier for a national VCD service to establish an official list of approved economic operators in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC. The national VCD service provider could use the information within its storage to maintain such lists. Evidence that is sufficiently described through context specific data could then for example be automatically validated by a national VCD service provider by putting validation values into a VCD. Stage 4 therewith improves the level of support for the economic operator since the need and burden to present specific attestations to the contracting authority will be eliminated. Stage 4 therewith fulfils the paradigm shift where a contracting authority only asks for the fulfilment of certain criteria and not for the delivery of specific evidence. It changes the general approach of providing attestations at the time of the bid but consequently performs all the related functionality of stages 2 and 3 (e.g. provision of structural data of evidence and context specific data). Stage 4 introduces the \"on-demand\" idea which allows retrieving evidence directly from the national VCD service provider on individual basis. In order to ensure the level of completeness, the VCD network package needs to be extended stepwise by including evidences which are sufficiently described through agreed and standardised contextspecific data and structural data of evidence (and which can easily be validated by the national VCD service provider when he accredits economic operators according to Article 52). We propose the following major building blocks to establish a VCD networked package: Compilation of evidence within a VCD is based on structural and context specific data. The compiled VCD network package only contains both data types and provides references to retrieve attestations when necessary (i.e. \u201con demand\u201d). The VCD contains references in the meaning of processing instructions for the contracting authority to retrieve the requested attestations on individual basis at the time of awarding. The reference or processing instruction includes a mechanism to grant access rights to the contracting authority in order to retrieve these attestations within a certain period of time; The national VCD service provider still handles the data retrieval from attestation services and holds evidence within a temporary storage. When the National VCD Service Provider receives a valid request at the time of awarding from a contracting authority mandated by the economic operator he delivers the requested evidence to the contracting authority; Stage 4 will provide a good opportunity to establish an official list of approved economic operators in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC. Evidences (and in particular those that are sufficiently described through context specific data) could be validated by a national VCD service provider by putting validation values into a VCD. Mechanisms for maintenance of evidence could potentially be implemented in order to keep the information up to date and respectively maintain a state of accredited economic operators. The difference between Stage 3 and 4 lies in the moment at which specific evidence will be requested or delivered. The VCD network package will include all the data that is necessary to qualify an economic operator according to the methods, rules and functions described in stages 2-3. The only difference is that some of these evidences are not directly included into the VCD but can be retrieved through references in order to allow the contracting authority to retrieve the evidence on individual basis or \u201con-demand\u201d. Stage 4 allows further implementations towards federated networks and provides opportunities to establish lists of approved economic operators in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC11. Table 6 provides an overview of the VCD network package outcome, approach, benefits and necessary efforts and/or limitations of the proposed concept.",
        "Stage 4 does not contain a modelled use case diagram that clarifies the system interaction and a detailed description of requirements because it mainly relies on the functions introduced in the previous stages and there are no pilots yet for this stage. Nevertheless the use case description provides a short textual explanation and major requirements of this stage are mentioned. Functions in round brackets ( ) are new to this use case: The economic operator requests a VCD on the basis of stages 1, 2 and 3 at the National Service Provider. The National Service Provider starts the VCD creation process by requesting attestations from Trusted Attestation Services that are connected to context specific networks. Trusted Attestation Services provide requested attestations to a local database or repository that is owned by the National VCD Service Provider (store attestation). The VCD system enables the economic operator to mandate the contracting authority to access his attestations within the VCD system if the attestations are sufficiently described through context specific data (mandate to request attestation through VCD specific reference) and the VCD system creates a specific reference into the VCD itself (set reference to attestation to VCD). When all attestations are compiled by the VCD system the economic operator can submit its VCD to the contracting authority. The contracting authority can now request attestations through the reference that is specified in the VCD (request attestation on individual basis). The VCD System checks whether the contracting authority has sufficient access rights and has been mandated by the economic operator to retrieve that attestation (check access rights). Afterwards the VCD system delivers the attestation to the contracting authority (retrieve attestation) or informs the economic about a request that cannot be handled adequately (conflict resolution). The economic operator than may have to provide an additional translation to the contracting authority within a certain period of time.",
        "This chapter contains the major feature, requirements and quality attributes which are derived from the vision statement and the use-case description of stage 4 and which extend the features, requirements and quality attributes of the previous stages. Feature: Mandate contracting authority The VCD system MUST provide functionality and an interface to the economic operator that enables him to mandate a certain contracting authority to request attestations on demand. Feature: Storing attestations and referencing to it The VCD system MUST detect which attestations can be used by this feature (e.g. they have to be sufficiently described through context specific data and structural data of evidence); The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that enables National VCD Service Providers to store attestations; A functionality for referencing to attestations MUST be implemented within the VCD system; The VCD system MUST ensure that a contracting authority is able to request attestations via the provided reference (including time-restrictions); The functionality for referencing to attestations within the VCD MUST be implemented, either VCD-specific or contracting authority-specific, in order to approve whether the contracting authority has sufficient rights for requesting the attestations; VCD-specific or contracting authority-specific reference to attestations MUST be stored within the VCD system (processing instructions). Feature: Retrieving attestations on demand The VCD system MUST provide a functionally to check whether a contracting authority has sufficient rights and has been mandated by the economic operator to retrieve attestations; The VCD system MUST provide a functionality and an interface that enables contracting authorities to retrieve the attestation from the storage; The VCD system MUST ensure that the attestation that is requested by the contracting authority is still valid at the time of awarding or when the Call for Tender is closed. Feature: Conflict resolution The VCD system MUST provide a functionality that initiates a conflict resolution process between economic operator and contracting authority if errors occur or when certain attestation or a translation cannot be delivered on demand. Feature: Implementing Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC and EFTA EEA Committee decision 68/2006 The VCD system SHOULD provide a functionality to approve attestations through validation data and to make this approval visible within a VCD networked package when a National VCD Service provider takes the role of a national validation point in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC and EFTA EEA Committee decision 68/2006. Quality attributes of VCD networked package There MUST be an access policy that is issued by the economic operator that mandates a contracting authority to request attestation from the national VCD service provider on demand; A general reference structure and syntax MUST be defined. This may include creating contracting authority specific or VCD specific references in order to identify a mandate that has been given by the economic operator to this contracting authority for retrieving attestation or even updates on it; National and local political commitments and service-level agreements MUST ensure that consensuses on roles and responsibilities are built with regard to this solution and in particular the National Service Providers who delivers attestations on demand; There MUST be a service-level agreement between the parties involved (Economic Operators, Contracting authorities, National Service Providers, and Trusted Attestation Service) about the response time of a delivery of attestations and data availability; There MUST be a service-level agreement between the parties involved (Economic Operators, Contracting authorities, National Service Providers, and Trusted Attestation Service) about conflict resolution that describe what to do when errors occur or when attestation or translations cannot be delivered \u201con demand\u201d; The attestations where an agreement on context specific formats can be reached most easily SHOULD be included first into the network; WP2 SHOULD provide easy solutions for displaying context specific data and should enable their validation through validation values; Legal systems MUST ensure that context specific data and validation values have an equivalent value to the provision of conventional / traditional attestations. (Scope of mutual recognition); The National Service Providers SHOULD establish validation points in order to approve an economic operator in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC; The national procurement law MUST ensure that National Service Provider can act as national validation points in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC for economic operators; Liability issues of the National Service Providers MUST be clarified when they act as national validation points in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC for economic operators; National procedures with regard to Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC MUST be mutually recognized and trusted in across borders.",
        "Stage 4 relies on several functionalities or concepts that have been already addressed and described in previous stages. Basically the VCD network package relies on most of the features and functionalities already described in the previous stages. Nevertheless some of them take a particular role for implementing stage 4: Stage1: Mapping of evidence through pre-VCD mapping tool; Stage2: Compiling a VCD from several different kinds of data; Stage2 and 3: Implementation of direct access to issuing bodies and further description of interfaces to provide structural data of evidence and context specific data; Stage 2 and 3: The provision of data of evidence and context specific data of electronic attestations in order to approve attestations easily; Stage 2 and 3: Agreement on structural data of evidence and context specific data and description of national subsets of it in order to avoid the delivery of translations; Stage 3: A semantic standardisation of context specific data that describe the major contents of attestations which have a relatively uniform structure and uniform contents. WP2 should also provide easy solutions for transforming complex information contained in attestations into simple representations. For example a balance sheet could be much more easily represented electronically if a specific tender would only demand to fulfil a certain range of capital (e.g. until 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / \u2026) that has to be met by the economic operator; Stage 3: Possibilities to update a VCD and therewith enabling the national VCD service provider to take the role of a validation point in order to implement Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC. In addition, Stage 4 will introduce the \u201con-demand\u201d approach. Providing \u201con-demand\u201d access to evidence requires the necessity to establish a National VCD Service Provider which is electronically connected to all attestation providers in the economic operator\u2019s country. In order to avoid the necessity to establish a connectivity matrix from all contracting authorities to all attestation providers, the national VCD service provider has to act as a proxy. Depending on the implementation mechanism, the retrieval of \u201con-demand\u201d data can either be realized: By enacting highly available, high performing online interfaces from the proxy to all attestation providers in the economic operator\u2019s country. This first approach is extremely ambitious but the only way to always access actualised data; By caching the attestations at the proxy. This second approach could be implemented with lower efforts but leads to the situation that the data provided by the VCD package is in the end as actual as the data provided by a VCD package that is compiled using the concept from stage 3. The relations between entities shown in the figure above imply to set up and share common access policies. They will be based upon technical, functional and organisational commitments related to authentication, mutual recognition, granting actors access rights, traceability and auditability of information and trust mechanism. On this basis updating functionalities and access mechanisms can be easily implemented. They could be performed within a \u201cPull model\u201d between contracting authorities and national service provider as well as between national service providers and attestation providers. The definition of pull models between those entities would allow several opportunities and flexibilities for example to update expired evidence or to request evidence on individual basis. In a \u201cperfect world\u201d a contracting authority could directly access to the latest attestation, but this is difficult to implement because a lot of entities and attestation providers have to be federated. To avoid this and several political as well data protection and privacy issues, the access to attestations should be done through a temporary storage hosted by the National Service Provider. We assume that the attestation must be valid when the call for tender is closed instead of pre-serving permanent validity of attestations at the temporary storage of the national VCD service provider. An organisational solution is necessary to solve conflicts that may appear when a contracting authority requesting attestations on individual basis and does not believe on the validation value given by the VCD. This could potentially include conflict resolution in cases of errors or when an economic operator has to produce a translation of the attestation in a certain period of time and to send it to the contracting authority via the national VCD service provider. Thinking about the future, we can imagine a scenario assisting the contracting authorities in lowering burden of validating attestations and lowering the burden for economic operators to provide attestations. A real added value in eTendering processes would be to reach a state where contracting authorities could only focus on the offer and where the main purpose of a VCD networked package is in trusting in its status ensured by a National VCD Service Provider. Stage 4 will provide a good opportunity to implement Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC. Article 52 provides guidance in making proof of exclusion and selection criteria much easier for the contracting authority. The interaction between the economic operator and the contracting authority can then be summarized by \u201ctrust in my National VCD Service Provider who holds the attestations for me\u201d. Obviously, there are several difficulties for such a model that include political considerations, auditability, traceability, liability, mutual recognition of procedures with regard to Article 52, trust between national VCD service providers etc. All those circumstances have to be solved before implementing a VCD networked package on the basis of Article 52. Nevertheless stage 4 provides guidance in how to connect both ideas in an easy way.",
        "Interoperability is a major topic being discussed in eGovernment for a while now. Already in 2003, the EC has published a working document, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), where the authors defined IOP as \u201cthe means by which the interlinking of systems, information and ways of working, whether within or between administrations, nationally or across Europe, or with the enterprise sector, occurs\u201d ((IDABC 2004), pp. 6). The document recalls IOP needs on technical, semantic and organizational layer with a rather wide understanding of IOP (IDABC 2004). In late 2008 a draft for a revised European Interoperability Framework was published by IDABC extending the requirement for IOP to five levels12: The aim of this chapter is to draw a picture about the current situation applied in the countries with regard to potentially placement of a VCD in the MS according to the European Interoperability Framework version 2 (EIF2): The legal framework thereby refers to appropriate synchronization of the legislation in the cooperating MS so that electronic data originating in any given MS is accorded to proper legal weight and recognition wherever it needs to be used in other MS. This includes rules with regard to tendering, submission and awarding including certificates and attestations that are typically required and their mapping to evidences and exclusion and selection criteria from a legal point of view; The organizational framework then refers to the processes by which different organizations such as different public administrations collaborate to achieve their mutually agreed eGovernment service-related goals. This includes best practices for tendering, submission and awarding derived from activities such as stakeholder analysis and stakeholder questionnaires that have been developed; The semantic framework ensures that the precise meaning of exchanged information (concepts, organization, services, etc) is preserved and well understood. It includes data aspects of the target solution with regard to common understanding, agreement procedure on shared definition of terms and mapping of evidence; The technical framework refers to technical issues involved in linking computer systems and services (interfaces, interconnection services, middleware, data exchange, accessibility, security services, and validation service\u2026). It specifically includes aspects with regard to the PEPPOL infrastructure for submitting a VCD across borders. Each chapter results in a framework for the application of a VCD, which is described through a set of requirements that haven been derived from the activities mentioned before.",
        "The organisational framework for the VCD has several dimensions. The use cases of the stages above show the actors that are involved and have to be addressed through the organisational framework e.g. economic operators, contracting authorities, issuing bodies, national service providers etc. Within the project it will be necessary to manage these different kinds of stakeholders by adequately integrating them into the project. Thereby it will be of importance to define their specific role and their importance for our work package within the lifetime of the project. Networks of gathering evidences are complex to handle because there are several stakeholders to consider. To avoid problems of involvement a clear approach of stakeholder analysis is needed. WP2 can only provide guidance to this since it will be a national responsibility. Austria for example has set up a physical stakeholder forum that informs key stakeholder in regular time intervals about the results of PEPPOL. Next to this the WP2 team of Austria is building up a participation platform13 where latest results are presented and can be further discussed within forums and mini surveys. Each member state has to define its own strategy to involve stakeholders during the lifetime of the project. WP2 has developed a template for stakeholder management that may provide guidance for this. It can be found in ANNEX IV: Template for stakeholder analysis. To ensure a wide acceptance of the solutions provided by WP2 among stakeholders we have to prevent changes in national procedures and infrastructures but to utilize them as much as possible. In stages 2, 3 and 4 it will be necessary to establish a national service provider who will take care about critical VCD processes and therewith ensure legitimacy, trust and appropriate change management. Any VCD solution should provide universal support for economic operators of any size. Testing of a VCD solution will be very important and should be done by reprocessing historical tenders in order to avoid problems of disqualification due to errors of applications. Another important part of the stakeholder analysis is the identification of recognized public and private issuing bodies. This may be done through the support of DG Markt\u2019s study (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2007) report on national country profiles14 and additional national analysis. These entities then need to be included into a list of recognized private and public issuing bodies which will be an important part when defining structural data of evidence (e.g. issuer, availability, delivery time etc). A national VCD application may list several different issuing bodies that provide the same attestation. These may have different characteristics as for example price, availability or delivery time. However the choice which attestation is most appropriate should be left to the economic operator but this decision may be supported through displaying these different characteristics. If an economic operator for example decides to rely on a manual issuing service that cannot be directly invoked by a national service provider it is the responsibility of the economic operator to provide this attestation and act as issuing body by uploading it to the system of the national service provider in order to create a VCD package. Each national service provider provides a national VCD solution in accordance to the key principles mentioned in the use cases. National solutions therefore may vary due to freedom of implementing national solutions but conformance to key issues should ensure their interoperability. A key issue for example is the pre-VCD mapping tool and it should be integrated into any national solutions either as a module or as interface to query results for the mapping of evidences among member states. To enable automated information processing on the basis of the pre-VCD mapping tool within national solutions additional structured information has to be defined within the Call for Tender that enables the retrieval of qualification and selection criteria from contracting authorities. A contracting authority therefore has to specify a relevant criteria subset within a Call for Tender which can then for example be referred to by an economic operator by providing the ID of a Call for Tender to the national solution. Two phased tendering is not explicitly foreseen by the VCD even if it might be used for this purpose. In most cases we do not see great efforts for economic operators in two-phased since many countries only required the submission of self-declarations. None of the above mentioned solutions explicitly requires implementing Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC. Thus the VCD itself provides support for the proofing of conformance but it does not provide any information whether an economic operator is conform. In stages 3 and 4 a higher \u201clevel of decision making\u201d is promoted and we see especially the provision of context specific data (stage 3) and the on demand approach (stage 4) as a pre-conditions that ease the establishment of lists of approved economic operators across borders. However if there is a country that wishes to enable such a proof in the VCD it can be done before but will require several manual efforts. Although such proof of conformance should rely on Articles 45 and 46 of directive 2004/18/EC first.",
        "The requirements listed in the subsequent section have been identified and are essential for any WP2 solution. They are independent of a particular stage or show interrelations between them thus they are called high-level organisational requirements. The requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed and specified in the project lifetime in order to further draft the organisational framework for a VCD to a greater extend.",

        "Today\u2019s work in public administration is still strongly based on the work with documents and files. With the consideration of data object and document flow, a disambiguation of the terms used is reasonable to clarify the concepts. Electronic documents can be text, tables, images or a combination of these and are available in digital form. Generally, this comprises each potentially permanent recording of data on a data carrier. Many European states allow the use of electronic documents as a replacement for documents in written form. Such documents find also application in tendering procedures and shall be part of VCD. Thus the electronic document is the central means for Public eProcurement and for the usage of a VCD on pan-European level. The characteristics of a document are combined from physical shape (paper or electronic file), formal properties (e.g. structure and style), organisational properties (functional relation, version, indexing in a filing plan), content, document type (storage obligations, legal character, editability), time stamping (creation, expiry, last access), editors (sender, creator, author) and users (receiver, (last) editor, reader). Official documents need to fulfil specific requirements like completeness, integrity and transparency. Apart from this, they also need to conform to the legality principle of administrative actions and to audit trails. A file (record) is a factual and task-related arrangement and collection of documents which belong together. The goal is to keep the content available and traceable at any time. Files are recorded with a unique identification. This chapter describes the semantic framework of work package 2 that comprise solutions for the VCD from the data perspective. Section 3.2.2 therefore provides a brief overview about general patterns for data representation and utilisation. Thereby different data perspectives have to be separated that comprise a VCD: Structural data of VCD-Package: Data that describe a VCD package; Economic operator data: Data that describe an economic operator; Tender specific data: Data that describe a specific Call for Tender; Structural data of evidence: Data that describe the structure of an attestation; Context specific data: Data that describe the content of an evidence; Validation data: Data that describe the validation of a certain criteria; Evidences: Attestations and candidate statements; Translations: Translation of attestations. In order to provide solutions for these different perspectives each one needs to be analysed and further defined. Important information for defining those types of data can be derived from already existing studies, reports and literature. A VCD than will have to consider several standards and methodologies that relate to record management and metadata development. Beside we will build upon the results provided by CEN/BII. Relevant standards and methodologies are mentioned in section 3.2.3. Section 3.2.4 then provides a list of requirements that are important for the VCD and its pre-VCD mapping tool. This includes for example the level of completeness of a VCD and a pre-VCD mapping tool, principles for including attestations, the use of placeholders for evidences that cannot be further classified, the specification of semantics and the visualization of a VCD package.",
        "The Vision of the VCD comprises several different concepts such as visualization of data (e.g. stage2: visualisation of a VCD), sending / receiving data elements (e.g. stage 2: collecting evidence or stage 4: requesting attestation on demand), transferring data (e.g. stage 2: submission of a VCD) and routing of data (stage 4: exchange of validation values). To further clarify their interrelation we take the research by (Russel N., Hofsteded A.H.M. et al. 2005) of data occurrences in systems into account that characterize following categories: Data visibility; Data interaction; Data transfer; Data based routing. Data visibility refers to the context in which data can be defined and utilised. The binding to specific constructs directly influences the way in which data may be used (e.g. intermediate results at task level or global data storage during execution of a specific case). Crossing the borders of one system and organisation, means have to be available to ensure the needed visibility. Data interaction patterns investigate on the different passing of data between components. Most data interaction appears on two forms (see Table 8 for more details): One component sends data unscheduled to another one (Push); One component receives data unscheduled (Pull). Data transfer adds the view on how to pass data between components to the dimension of data interaction. The way of communicating data depends on given access rights, a shared common data space, on the kind and type of data and the design of the workflow, which takes the before mentioned factors into account. A more detailed view on cross-organisational data transfer is given in Table 9. Data based routing considers the influence of data in the workflow on the control-flow. Descriptions include control-flow decisions on existence, appearance or the value of data. This set of patterns is the cross-link of data patterns and control-flow patterns. Though it is question of data visibility and data interaction if data-based routing is applicable in respect to interoperability.",

        "A selection of such documents will be included in any VCD; they will be produced by national units according to national legislation. This means that their content of data and information will vary. Both manual and automated cross border evaluation processes will require information about the legal validity of the documents, record by record. This means that the records of these documents need to be tagged for the processing. The label can give access to contextual information, like a country\u2019s legislation and constraints valid for the very document. Methods are specified in ISO 15489-117 \u201cRecords Management\u201d, and European requirements are detailed in MOREQ II18.

        "PEPPOL WP2 is investigating how to apply ISO 15489 to describe the structure and content of: Evidence of a company\u2019s identity (Extracts of commercial records or equivalent documents); Evidence of compliance with fiscal obligations (Declarations from fiscal services or equivalent documents). Both record by record according to the said standard; the goal is to obtain agreed descriptions that are applicable in participating states. The descriptions will be valid in all the defined stages, and it will prepare for fully automated processing. The processing of records, information and data requires standardised metadata; the metadata themselves need to be agreed between existing and potential users. The methodology of ISO 11179 will be used for specifications that can be used to detail the profiles developed by CEN BII WG 1. This means that the VCD can be developed from a collection of paper documents to a file that can be processed according to agreed CEN BII profiles by the use of the two standards. The CEN BII description of a VCD will be neutral when it comes to semantics, and it will be helpful for systems based on both UBL and UN/CEFACT; applications can accordingly be set up by use of any of them.",

        "Description A VCD package will show its full potential only when all requested evidences (all that are necessary to prove all the requested criteria) are contained within it. The range of attestations varies from selfdeclarations to official attestations/certificates issued by public authorities. From a very pragmatic point of view it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of attestations in a first step and to complete the VCD Package later on. It is also reasonably to define, where and when permitted, a default packaging list of tender independent criteria to be served without the burden of reading or interpreting the \u201cCall for Tender\u201d. Several requirements can be derived. Requirement When implementing any tool, system or service WP2 MUST focus on mandatory requirements and evidences mentioned in Articles 45 and 46 first since theses Articles are not tender-specific and therewith relevant for nearly all tenders. Measurement Any definition, specification, modelling or implementation will first focus on Article 45 to 46 Requirement The mapping between evidences via requirements MUST have set a primary focus on the mandatory requirements and evidences of a VCD. Measurement The definition, specification, modelling or implementation of the pre-VCD mapping tool will focus on Articles 45 to 46 Requirement Articles 47 to 50 open a wide range of different criteria which are tender- and country-specific thus they MUST be added stepwise to the pre-VCD mapping tool (which may require a higher-level mapping).

The attestations can be requested by the contracting authority on individual basis at the time of awarding and selection of candidates. Validation values (e.g. certified \u201cYes/No\u201d statements) should only be applied to networks where sufficient context specific data is available in order to approve this value. The validation value should be able to prove conformance to criteria of qualitative exclusion and selection unambiguously. This principle should be applied wherever possible for example: \u2022 The economic operator has to prove that he paid fiscal taxes according to national regulations \u2013 in this case a \u201cYes/No statement\u201d will be sufficient. \u2022 The economic operator has to provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order to proof its economic or financial standing \u2013 in this case the whole attestation (balance sheet or extracts of it) has to be delivered. - If sufficient context specific data format for representing those information unambiguously is available it may be applied for stage 4.

        "Public procurement requires strict compliance with the legal frameworks provided by the procurement directives. Supporting pan-European procurement and implementing services to enable pan-European deployment of evidences is the major goal of PEPPOL WP2. Any WP2 solution therefore needs to comply with the legal requirements concerning selection and exclusion criteria in public procurement defined by the European procurement directives and in national implementing legislation. Compliance with these regulations will ensure acceptance of a solution and will ensure and help to establish a \"level of trust\" between the parties involved. Therefore a comprehensive analysis of the relevant legal regulation has to take place. To get an overview on the legal requirements and regulations on different levels the following sources have to be analysed: European level (e.g. directive 2004/18/EG); National level (e.g. national procurement acts, other related regulations). The recommended process to extract the legal requirements of a VCD service or VCD service provider follows the maturity path, defined within WP 2, starting with the \"Status quo\" and ending up with \"Stage 4\". At each level limitations and requirements have been identified with respect to legal requirements. Any technical VCD solution requires legal interoperability in order to being used without doubts. Legal interoperability of a VCD requires the comparison of legal conditions within the Member States. National procurement legislation implements the directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC but vary due to different national conditions and practices. In cross-border procurement the national law often has to be enriched through principles mentioned in the relevant directives. When developing a solution the differences between national procurement acts and the European Directive has to be taken into account in order to define a solution that is conform to national law and can be applied on a pan- European level. The comparison of legal aspects has been done by comparing the national legislation on eTendering with respect to the European legislation. A set of 40 legal questions has been developed in order to describe the national legal environment with regard to the relevant Articles of the above mentioned directive and to draw conclusions from it. Those legal questions often target critical aspects for a potential VCD solution as for example the role and use of self declarations as replacement for documents that can not be issued within one Member State. The legal analysis provides guidance in analysing the national legal frameworks and their principles with regard to cross-border tendering, submission of evidence and the awarding of contracts within Member States. The legal analysis thereby discusses in particular the following topics: Proof of suitability and exclusion criteria; Types, formality and processing of evidence; Implications of different procedures, services, thresholds and bidding syndicates; Other issues like data protection and storage, use of signatures, liability.

Other economic operators have to provide similar evidence instead (e.g. a candidate statement). The working group has to provide a concept of how each possible attestation has to be fulfilled (mapping of evidences defined in the directive with national implementation).

        "This chapter shall include technical requirements that are essential for submitting a VCD via the PEPPOL infrastructures. In particular this refers to the proposed infrastructure of WP8 and the interrelation with our work package. The PEPPOL infrastructure of WP8 is dedicated in particular to the exchange of electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner. Thereby it connects to existing e-business frameworks and value added networks and is being built on existing technologies and standards that have been tested and which have proven to be reliable and secure for enterprise use. WP2 takes a specific role within the project by concentrating on pre-awarding issues where requirements and procedures are often stricter due to principle like equal treatment, nondiscrimination, transparency, competition etc. Although a VCD does not include the offer itself it provides several documents that are of great importance for the award of contracts and therewith critical for the success of an economic operator for example in cases of disqualification because of late delivery of a VCD. An overall pre-condition for using the infrastructure and WP2 solutions in long term is that they are governed even after the project lifetime by maintaining and sustaining its functions. Therefore the governing models of WP8 and WP2 should be aligned. Authentication is an essential feature of WP2 as a Virtual Company Dossier contains several documents that contain sensitive data about an economic operator. Hence, it has to be ensured that only those persons that have sufficient rights are able to access and retrieve these data. Authentication of origin is also an important feature with regard to non-repudiation, for example when submitting a VCD to a contracting authority. Authentication is a verification of evidence of identity; for individuals and companies identifiers are used to process authentication. Such identifiers are national and in many countries specific and maintained within sectors, like tax, health, health insurance, employment, registration authorities, etc. PEPPOL will need to design an authentication system that serves its purposes. Hence, collaboration with WP 1 will be strengthened in the second phase of WP 2. Time-stamping shall ensure that the submission of a VCD is adequately documented for example to verify that it has been sent or received previously to the closure of a call for tender. In order to obtain trust, the VCD services should use certified time stamps. Moreover there are several actors involved in the WP2 scenarios which need to be connected to the PEPPOL infrastructure thus a sufficient allocation of identifiers, in connection with the identity an actor claims to have, has to be ensured. This shall ensure that unauthorized usage of an individuals\u2019 identity is avoided. Overall we see a need for commonly monitored identity and access management in particular for all national VCD solutions and for the PEPPOL infrastructure thus both approaches should be aligned and should make use of the same mechanisms through for example single-sign-on functionality. Apart from functionalities like addressability and discovery, the infrastructure should provide access points to support the actors or services to connect to the infrastructure. The PEPPOL infrastructure will make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner. Thus also the VCD should be able to be submitted through the PEPPOL infrastructure. We also assume that a VCD in stages 2 and 3 can be potentially submitted through other means but this is up to the choice of an economic operator and should not be promoted because bypassing the infrastructure is critical from the viewpoint of using validation services to ensure confidentiality of a VCD and its contained documents (WP1) and secure and reliable transport ensured through the PEPPOL infrastructure (WP8). During transportation the integrity of a VCD has to be ensured when for example validating it. Usage of the Infrastructure will require that national access points to the infrastructure (e.g. national service providers, contracting authorities) will be implemented but also direct access points that support SMEs in connecting to it. We also see a potential need to access web services via the infrastructure that enable client-side code generation in SOAP frameworks for example for the retrieval of attestations on demand, connecting to tendering platforms or viewing the VCD on some platform at the national service provider.",

The next section provides an overview of relevant technologies that may enable such a mapping of evidence.",
        "This section provides an overview about relevant technologies that can be applied for a pre-VCD mapping tool. The pre-VCD mapping tool is depending upon formal semantics that describe how evidences related to each other. Therefore WP 2 proposes to derive criteria from the European directive 2004/18/EC as shown for instance within the \u201cEligibility of Tenderers\u201d. Using formal semantics with the proposed technologies as presented in section 4.1.3 below enables several advantages (Fensel, Lausen et al. 2007): Enable mapping: This involves the creation of certain rules and axioms that define how terms or evidences within one Member State map to terms and evidences within another Member State; Enable alignment: Refers to the commitment that has to be made in order to determine correspondences between concepts. Alignment is used to find classes of data that are semantically equivalent, but indeed not necessarily logically identical (e.g. Extracts of judicial records or equivalent documents); Enable translation: Refers to syntactic rewriting and semantic rewriting to support the translation between two different representations of data; Enable merging: Describes the creations of a common model that is used instead of the national models. Merging different national models into a unified one is an approach for semantic integration which is particularly used when national models overlap significantly over a common domain. The usage of formal semantics is an extension which allows annotating syntactical contents in a format that is machine-understandable. Formal semantics enables users to share and integrate information easily by using descriptive technologies like the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the data-centric Extensible Markup Language (XML). These languages provide a foundation for semantic interoperability. They are combined to give a well-defined meaning to the information and data exchanged in order to provide machine-readable descriptions and to enable machine-to-machine communication. The semantic theory derives information from data through the interpretation of symbols and allows formalizing the meaning of symbols by connecting the relevant terms in logical means. The semantic theory therewith provides mechanisms to enable semantic interoperability between heterogeneous systems. The key technologies for enabling semantic interoperability are shown by the semantic web layer cake in Figure 20 (Shadbolt, Hall et al. 2006). Each layer is based and depends on the layer below, but lower layers do not depend on higher layers. The layers can be developed relatively independently. Each layer has a greater level of specialization and tends to be more complex than the layers below it. Most of the technologies that are shown in the diagram are W3C developed or endorsed. Thus there are potential alternatives for some of the layers (Passin 2004), (Shadbolt, Hall et al. 2006), (Fensel 2001): For enabling machines to process data directly, database objects have to be mapped into a system of URIs. URIs using a global naming convention to identify resources thus they are central for semantic interoperability. Resources are associated with a URI so that anyone can link / refer to it and may access an appropriate representation of it; XML provides a standard serial syntax for exchanging data and it is becoming the standard for data interchange on the web. However, XML and its schema languages do not express the meaning of the content but rather structure, e.g. nesting information. XML documents are usually based on different schemas but they may represent data with similar semantics; RDF is a general method for modelling metadata, through a variety of syntax formats. RDF provides a standard form for representing semantics of data which can be processed by machines. The RDF metadata model allows to define statements about resources by using so called triple stores (subject-predicate-object expressions). Resources in RDF are connected to specific URIs that allow to derive information about the resource and its meaning. RDF is an application of XML thus it provides an XML-based syntax for recording and exchanging RDF information; OWL is designed to enable applications to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL facilitates greater expressivity and machine interpretability of content than that supported by XML and RDF by providing additional vocabulary (e.g. relationships between entities) along with a formal semantics. The main idea of OWL is to support an efficient representation of ontologies as well as the support of decision procedures. OWL allows to refer to terms in other ontologies and it uses the linking provided by RDF to enable the distribution of ontologies among different systems; Logical reasoning is needed to ensure the consistency and correctness of data sets. It is used to infer conclusions that are not explicitly stated but are consistent with and required by a known set of data. Proofs are needed in order to trace the steps of logical reasoning22; Trust aims at the provision of authentication mechanisms and the evidence of the trustworthiness of data, services, and agents. RDF is the basic layer for data representation because it is designed to allow data from different sources to be written in the same form and therefore distributed between different systems. RDF is based on existing standards such as XML and URI. On top of RDF, the ontology layer is being developed under use of OWL or any other ontological language. The layers above RDF are the subject to many prototype systems that are built to enable a higher degree of semantic interoperability between heterogeneous systems. Depending on further detailed specification of the pre-VCD mapping, WP 2 partners will make a decision to use either a simplified ontology mapping based on XML or to embark on more powerful technologies such as RDF or OWL in order to ensure wider interoperability and provide mapping and translation features as indicated above.",

Through an enlargement of PEPPOL, further pilot implementations are aimed at, including: France and Norway intend to implement stage 4; Belgium, Czech Republic and Greece aim to implement VCD packages of stages 2-3; Sweden intends to implement stage 1. Besides these pilot implementations in the context of WP 2, the WP 2 project partners also aim at collaborating intensely with potential activities of the EC (DG MARKT) to implement the pre-VCD mapping tool. With a total of eight pilot implementations plus the European Service Provider implementation of the pre-VCD mapping tool, the WP 2 will reach a wide geographical spread as well as a profound proof of the overall VCD concept. Since the VCD implementation also touches national demands for existing infrastructures to access and retrieve evidences from issuing bodies (see the lower part of Country A in Figure 21), such infrastructures and required identity and access management for accessing local issuing bodies are considered as parts of national infrastructures where PEPPOL will embark on. Hence, individual Member State countries will already have such infrastructures and access mechanisms in place or will have to implement them within national scope. The PEPPOL pilot implementations will give indications of technical implementations at national level and how the PEPPOL pan-European VCD systems may interact and be interconnected with national and/or regional systems of issuing bodies for further rollout of the VCD concept in Europe.",
        "Austria will implement and pilot a VCD service based on the VCD concept introduced in this report. The intention is to create a system, which can handle all functions of a stage 3 VCD advanced package solution, and thereby achieve: full pan-European interoperability,; flexibility to meet the dynamics of the organisational and legal changes and. The Austrian VCD system will give a living proof of concept of complex pan-European constellations, where interoperability is a key success factor for the whole VCD concept. Figure 22 demonstrates the scenario for an example of a complex pan-European tendering process with stakeholders of different nationalities to be handled by the VCD solution: a consortium of economic operators (either equal bidding partners from AT and IT, or Austrian main bidder with Italian subcontractor) responds to a tender of a Norwegian contracting authority. In order to understand, which qualification, selection and non-exclusion criteria have to be evidenced, the Austrian Tender Structure Element 1 (TSE1) consults the pre-VCD mapping tool provided by an European VCD service provider. Based on the information retrieved, the Austrian VCD implementation will deliver a VCD package containing all the evidences that are necessary to prove the selection and qualification criteria requested by any contracting authority regardless of its nationality (i.e. in the case of the scenario example provided in Figure 22: all evidences and declarations to be provided by TSE1, TSE2 and TSE3 to fulfil the requests of the Norwegian contracting authority). With this design concept, the Austrian pilot will implement a complex rule set that reflects the legal requirements regarding criteria and evidence selection determined in the EU-directive 2004/18/EC as well as in national implementations of this directive. This way, the Austrian VCD implementation will ensure full pan-European interoperability and will lead to a dynamic situation regarding the legal rule set and its flexibility to adapt to legal and organisational changes. In its implementation, the Austrian VCD pilot makes use of an execution engine directly interpreting an ontology representing the internationally agreed upon rules (coding of the rule set is avoided altogether). This ontology is the logic basis in order to orchestrate the necessary services collecting the required evidences for a given tender. Changes in the rule set will directly result in changes in the orchestration logic without any coding tasks and are executed immediately. Consequently, the implementation will be highly flexible and dynamic. UI/Workflow-System This component handles the interaction with the users of the system (e.g. requester of the VCD package) and copes with the necessary pan-European requirements regarding criterion selection, evidence selection and issuing service approval (including the interaction with the European VCD service provider regarding the pre-VCD mapping). The UI-component will provide the users with a web-client interface in order to support SMEs the best way possible; osSso Machine This component interprets the international rule set (ontology), generates a list of service to be called in order to furnish the required evidences for the given criteria and passes the resulting service chain to the SOA engine. The osSso machine is the core component of the Austrian VCD implementation and ensures the required flexibility described above through direct interpretation of the ontology without the need of programming. This component will be funded nationally outside the PEPPOL project; SOA Engine This component is in charge of calling the issuing service following the service chain, which has been constructed by the osSso machine. Part of the implementation will be the creation of issuing service profiles, which enable the integration of manual, semi-automated and automated Austrian issuing services. Due to the requirements of stage 3 regarding context-specific data this SOAengine strictly follows the design of the VCD advanced package data structures. To be as flexible as possible the data interchange protocols between the issuing services and engine itself will be based on international standards. The implementation of the SOA execution engine will also be an Austrian contribution to the WP2 implementation work funded nationally outside the PEPPOL project; VCD packager This component constructs the physical VCD package following the internationally agreed upon VCD advanced package design. The piloting approach is to change as few existing evidence issuing processes as possible in a first step, in order to quickly bring the VCD implementation into production. In a subsequent step, issuing services should be sequentially adapted to support automated data retrieval. This adaption will take place after the PEPPOL project.",
        "The piloting phase of the Austrian VCD implementation will include several selected stakeholders, which take up key positions in the Austrian procurement landscape. The following stakeholder groups will be represented in the Austrian pilot: Contracting authorities; Economic operators; Issuing bodies; Intermediaries (the VCD service provider). The VCD service provider for the piloting phase will be the Austrian Federal Computing Center (BRZ), which will establish and maintain the VCD service.",
        "Italy plans to adapt its current company\u2019s dossier builder to the design and implementation principles set by PEPPOL WP2. This requires a set of actions in order to conform to the adopted standards and interoperability agreements of PEPPOL WP2. The interoperability dimension represents the challenge at the moment as very few transactions take place across borders and when they are performed they represent a heavy burden for those attending their execution. Italy is pressing on this by adopting different measures, i.e., by improving the organizational infrastructure, by offering better visibility of the involved organizations, by designing and developing policies that increase the trust among national and European organizations, by improving the information processing environment in order to reach the requirements set by the PEPPOL community. The conformance to PEPPOL\u2019s WP2 interoperability standards will be approached by following the project agreed roadmap that includes the design and management of a dynamic knowledge base, known as the pre-VCD mapping tool and by implementing VCD services that conform to a multi-stage approach. For PEPPOL\u2019s project runtime, Italy is planning to reach Stage 2 as ultimate stage in its system and services evolution along with solid contributions for the analysis and design of the upper level stages. The Italian implementation approach includes a long preparation activity that focuses more on legal investigation rather than technical engineering. Currently, the major challenge on interoperability across Europe comes from the persistent non homogeneous legal background and the reluctant attitude towards digital objects, mostly on electronic documents, digital identities and public registries. We see the two aspects, i.e. the legal and technical closely related, and aim at treating them with equal priority. Effort will be spent on refining and consolidating the document\u2019s acquisition infrastructure that represents a multi-site networking system to reach the different certification authorities that are the authoritative suppliers of documents essential to the VCD package construction. A specific set of tasks will also address the transformation of evidences from the conventional form into an electronic form for computer assisted handling and management. As part of the interoperability dimension, there will be a supporting action for digging into existing certificates and dragging out of them the most valuable information.",
        "The piloting phase of the Italian VCD service will include the technical actions identified by the implementation plan and some interfacing events to reach selected stakeholders and define through their input the driving conditions for the VCD setup. This interfacing activity will precede the final design and the real pilot implementation. The VCD service provider for the piloting phase will be the Italian Business Registers System.",
        "This section provides an overview about the deliverable and in particular about major requirements for VCD interoperability. The requirements and contents contained in chapters 2, 3 and 4 can be aggregated according to the following aspects: Level of support: The different levels of support address the maturity of the service and the maturity of the VCD package, where the former correspond to the functionalities (e.g. compilation support vs. recompilation support) provided and the latter corresponds to the semantic richness of the provided information (e.g. information support vs. decision support). Level of completeness: A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested attestations (all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria) are contained in it. The VCD promotes a step wise approach in order to reach a sufficient level of completeness by concentrating first on evidences with regard to Articles 45 \u2013 46 and afterwards on evidences with regard to Articles 47 \u2013 50. Paradigm shift: The paradigm shift refers to the handling of documents to handling of information and electronic exchange of information in order to establish interoperability on the basis of mutual recognition. The VCD should encompass this change. Criteria for qualification and selection and non-exclusion: The criteria for qualitative selection and non-exclusion as defined in Article 45 to 50 of Directive 2004/18/EC are the common ground for building a cross border VCD service. Evidences will be connected to these criteria by further defining and grouping them into sub criteria and atomic criteria. Pre-VCD mapping tool: Provides a widely available tool which contains the up-to-date mappings of European criteria and evidences. The tool is build upon a basic semantic interoperability model consisting of relationships between evidences available in the Member States and European criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion (Superset). Tender specific requirements then have to be stated by contracting authorities according to the European criteria during notification phase in order to derive tender specific mapping results on evidences required to submit at tendering (Subset). VCD simple package: Establishment of a VCD system which consist of VCD services, hosted by a VCD service provider. VCD services are capable to collect evidences from different sources and compiling VCD packages from it. VCD simple package defines the structure of a package with regard to types of data. Types of data contained in a VCD: Provide the basis for a common structure of a VCD. Includes several data types (cf. ANNEX I \u2013 Glossary) to build the VCD from different sources and formats (e.g. tender specific data that refer to a particular Call for Tender, the evidences itself as electronic file or scanned copy and structural data of evidence that describe the evidences according to generic aspects). VCD advanced package: Introduces several additional VCD services that increase the level of support for the entities involved. Economic operators are for example enabled to maintain their data through re-compilation of a VCD or to merge their VCD with VCDs\u2019 from other economic operators in order to create groups of economic operators for bidding consortia. VCD advanced package also introduces context specific data as additional type of data that describe the content of an attestation in a machine interpretable format. VCD networked package: Introduces \u201con-demand\u201d retrieval of attestations that are sufficiently described through context specific data. The VCD networked package offers a good opportunity for a national service provider to establish official list of approved economic operators as foreseen in Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC. Therefore national service providers have to store attestations and referencing to it within the VCD. Contracting authorities are mandated to request attestations in individual cases (\u201con demand\u201d) if they do not trust on the list of approved economic operators. The VCD networked package needs conflict resolution in cases of failure or system errors during \u201con demand\u201d requests. Organisational Framework: Lists the requirements forming the organisational basis for implementing any of the VCD stages. They are independent of a particular implementation or stage thus they are called organisational requirements for a VCD. Legal Framework: Lists the requirements forming legal basis for any VCD stage. They are independent of a particular VCD implementation or stage thus they are called legal requirements for a VCD. Semantic Framework: Lists the requirements which form the semantic basis for any of the VCD stages. They are independent of a particular implementation or stage thus they are called semantic requirements for a VCD. Technical Framework: Referring to the PEPPOL infrastructure. The technical framework lists several requirements that are essential to specify the technical (transportation and validation) basis in order to submit any WP2 solution across borders. They are independent of a particular implementation or stage thus they are called technical requirements for a VCD. In a next step these results will be transformed into a SWOT Analysis identifying the Strengths and Weaknesses of the proposed concept and its market opportunities.",
        "SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of a project or intention. A SWOT analysis usually starts by defining an end state or objective which has been done for WP2 in chapter 2 and subsequent chapters. The aim of any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external factors that influence the achievements of this objective. SWOT analysis thereby groups key pieces of information into categories: Internal factors: The internal strengths and weaknesses of the proposed project; External factors: The opportunities and threats presented by the external environment to the project. The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon their impact on WP2 objectives. What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective. The external factors may include market opportunities and threats, technological change, legislation, and political considerations23.",
        "The major objective of this deliverable is to develop a concept for a VCD and to define major requirements that shape this VCD concept. Therefore we have defined different scenarios and a vision that contains several different levels of maturity. With the staged maturity model we intend to reach a wide flexibility and openness of such a solution encompassing all Member States to implement their individual preferences. Nevertheless the concept provides common grounds such as the pre-VCD mapping and structural data of evidences which ensures interoperability of evidences and their perception across borders. Beside we defined a set of requirements on organisational, semantic, technical and legal level that clarify general aspect of VCD development and deployment. To support the mutual recognition of evidences across border the VCD requires an underlying semantic model that enables a standardized classification and mapping between them (pre-VCD mapping tool). If the contracting authority specifies the relevant evidences which are related to criteria, the data can be processed automatically in order to look-up the evidences required within another Member State. The standard structure of the VCD, with the semantic enrichment of its structure then provides a European-wide understanding and format of company formal evidence. The different levels of maturity can be applied in dependence on the willingness and readiness of every Member State. The aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels. Thereby each maturity level is built upon the lower ones thus allowing integration and stepwise advancement. The VCD shall ensure that a significant part of the public procurement processes can be made through electronic cross-border transactions. Therefore the national focus of a VCD needs to be enhanced through a cross border perspective. The VCD will provide the possibility to utilize evidences used in one Member State and to submit them across borders to any European contracting authority. A VCD provides a single point of contact for an economic operator that enables him to invoke and manage different services to create a VCD. A service (re-)compiles the VCD package for the economic operator or even a group of economic operators. The VCD services merge data from several sources into a single container and make this data available and understandable to the actors involved. Economic operators will be enabled to perform checks with regard to the existence and validity of the requested evidences in the VCD package. Structural data of evidence will provide guidance for foreign contracting authorities to understand the evidences contained within a VCD and they can trust that general information since it is provided by national VCD service providers that take the role of trusted parties. Context specific data will be provided on the higher levels to increase decision support.",
        "There are also some weaknesses that can be identified for the overall concept. These weaknesses are mostly derived from the complexity of the domain and how the VCD solution reacts on this domain. One of the biggest weaknesses is probably the development of context specific data for the evidences within a VCD. The development of context specific data shall ensure the automatic processing of electronic attestations without regard to linguistic barriers. The development of standards and context specific vocabularies is time consuming and requires long term involvement of user groups that will make use of these standards. The VCD contains several different kinds of evidences and to develop common standards for each one cannot be a major task and focus of this work package and should be done by initiative such as CEN BII, BRITE, XBRL or ECRIS. Since CEN BII workshop is close to an end it will probably not work out to do this development within its scope. Nevertheless we will start to develop comm of contents and marginal variances in their contents. Furthermore we rely on structural data of evidences that describe and characterize evidence from a more generic point of view. The possibility to replace the full document translation with a \u201cselective translation\u201d through context specific data (keywords and major contents) bares certain risks. The \u201cselective translation\u201d could be arranged in multiple languages in particular when context specific data belongs to a common agreed dictionary of expressions. Nevertheless the acceptance of those selective translations instead of certified translations may be questionable for contracting authorities. Thus the resolution of language barriers and linguistic issues cannot be completely managed by a VCD in short term and may require adding official translations beside selective translations. Provision of context specific data is a precondition to establish direct information exchange between attestation providers and contracting authorities. This direct information exchange would provide many opportunities with regard to increase the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction costs of the parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD. Nevertheless such direct exchange is very difficult to establish because a lot of entities and attestation services have to be federated, access policies have to be developed, legal uncertainties have to be resolved and political guidelines have to be considered. To circumvent these problems the VCD provides in particular in stage 4 a guideline on how to move forward in order to reach this ambitious aim but it will not be a major focus of a VCD as such. The VCD will be dependent on a number of services that rely on manual and semi-automated input. Thus the VCD system will be primary a tool for the economic operator to arrange a VCD package instance which is conform according to the requirements stated in particular call for tender which he can fill through additional inputs. A direct access to attestation via the national VCD service provider can only be provided for those public attestations that are already available in electronic format. The VCD will not enforce any development of electronic attestation on a national level as this is a clear national duty and is depended upon the development of context specific data. Nevertheless existing attestations may be extended through additional annotations that describe these documents generically (structural data of evidences). Unclear yet is the role of Member States that have already implemented Article 5224. The scope of mutual recognition needs to be further clarified with regard to acceptance of these procedures across borders and the liability of those trusted third parties across borders. It needs to be further defined how a VCD can support countries that have implemented Article 52 but since there are currently no pilots in our work package that have such procedures already implemented we have left this out of scope. Neverton representations (context specific data) for evidences that have an, easy structure, low quantityheless we see a great opportunity to combine both ideas as shown in stage 4.",
        "A major point of discussion in the domain is a sustainable and reliable long-term vision for exchanging attestations among Member States. In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the contracting authorities\u2019 need to proof conformance to certain criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion while reducing the burden of proof for the Economic Operator. The costs of transaction of economic operators can be reduced through a single point of contact and through automatic arrangement of a VCD package instance according to the given criteria. Therewith manual comparison of tender specific requirements is being omitted. The same burden lays on contracting authorities who have to check for each evidence whether the issuer has appropriate rights within that country to provide evidence. Furthermore the possibility to re-use evidences that are still valid (time) and the maintenance of a VCD will again provide possibilities for cost reductions at the side of the economic operator. A paradigm shift towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and certificates that are currently barely available in electronic form may be promoted by a VCD. At least the structural representation of attestation will provide benefit for the entities involved by providing transparency about the tendering requirements and the evidences that have to be submitted in cross border procedures. The pre-VCD mapping tool in particular will ensure transparency on cross border tendering requirements and will give indications about mutual recognition of evidences across borders. In contrast a VCD package contains the data necessary to prove the suitability of an economic operator according to these requirements. Therewith the VCD ease the overall procedure, may raise the number of cases of cross border procurements and may raise possibilities for greater competition across borders.",
        "Challenges to be dissolved when facing in particular the European perspectives of a VCD are mentioned by (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2008): organisational complexity e.g. the diversity of business certificates and attestations and the large amount of market players; technical complexity e.g. several interoperability issues including standardisation, provision of agreed semantics, ease of deployment and the cross-border use of eSignatures, formats and protocols; legal issues e.g. validity of certificates and attestations, data protection, proof of authenticity and general legal requirements; language barriers e.g. translation of business certificates and documents into the target language; financial consequences e.g. infrastructure changes may raise the expenditures for the public sector; political consideration e.g. procurement competences of Member States are often allocated on a decentralised level. The creation of uniform infrastructure in this heterogeneous domain will take time since several different environments and stakeholders need to be involved and change may not be enforceable to all of them. In this respect the VCD should support current practices in exchanging evidence in the short-run and lead towards smooth, reliable and sustainable exchange of electronic evidence among Member States in the long-run.",
        "The requirements specification at hand lays the ground for further development towards a VCD. The report lists requirements that scope a potential solution according to the different levels of maturity and generic requirements. These requirements now have to be taken further into account in order to specify the VCD and implement the various stages. To facilitate management of the requirements, they will be transformed into a spreadsheet with information as shown in Table 11. A distinction will be made among functional requirements, non-functional requirements and requirements that specifically refer to the development process. The spreadsheet will be used in the project in order to maintain, adapt and perform change management to the requirements over the project lifetime. Maintaining them over the project lifetime will ensure that the requirements are complete, explicitly defined, clearly described, numbered and referenced. Further characteristics to evaluate the quality of requirements will be considered such as their determinability (atomic character), verifiability (well defined measurement towards the fulfilment of a requirement), traceability (tracking of complete fulfilment as well as of where a requirement emerged from) and consistency (conflicts between requirements such as contrary features or quality aspects). The requirements will be the basis for further development and will provide guidance and reference to subsequent activities. Taking the PEPPOL development infrastructure guidelines, SCRUM25 or the waterfall model (McDermind_and_Rook, 1991) as reference models, the next phase focuses now on the detailed design of the VCD concept as presented above. This phase will further detail the requirements through explicit models and artefacts that describe relevant process flows, data characteristics and software. Drafting agreed models requires interdisciplinary work between participants with different skills. Software engineers thereby may design a software model for the mapping of evidences together with legal experts that ensure the legitimacy of such a model. Furthermore we intend to work closely together CEN BII workshop and DG Markt (including Siemens and Time.lex) when drafting these models in order to ensure long term sustainability of the solution envisaged. The shared artefacts then can provide the basis for the implementation stage. They will also be fed back to the requirements and may enforce change to them.",
        "The report at hand aimed at documenting the functional and non-functional requirements for a Virtual Company Dossier. Departing from a description of the current procedure when economic operators collect the necessary evidences as proofs of selection and exclusion criteria in public tenders, the team of work package 2 has elaborated a four-stage vision for the VCD. This four-stage concept takes into consideration different strategies and levels of development in the provision of evidences within Member States. With the implementation of stage 1, the pre-VCD mapping, a first level of interoperability and facilitation to collect the necessary evidences for a public tender in another Member State is supported. The VCD concept, however, fosters higher maturity degrees, i.e. interoperability and facilitation for both, economic operators and procuring agencies through machinereadable and computable VCD packages containing the individual evidences. Throughout the analysis, elaboration and definition of the VCD concept plus the necessary research affiliated with this activity, fruitful insights could be collected about dependencies and interrelationships, which make this domain rather complex. The project team is aware of the fact that the VCD concept conceptualised in this report is rather generous \u2013 especially if we attempt to implement stage 4 of the VCD vision. A big step towards interoperability and cross-border facilitation in the collection of company information of economic operators can already be made when implementing the pre-VCD mapping tool. Consequently, a recommendation is given to focus implementation on the pre-VCD mapping tool for widespread application of a VCD at first hand. This very first level of interoperability and semantic mapping is the basis for the subsequent stages. Nonetheless, the big potentials of interoperability, of facilitation, of cost savings and of reduction of administrative burden lay in the implementation of stages 3 and 4. The two pilots scheduled within WP 2 will concentrate their efforts on these latter stages, and hence will evidence the potentials of these stages. They form the test cases for a wider rollout of the VCD concept as developed throughout phase 1 of work package 2 within PEPPOL.",

Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user\u2019s behaviour and adapting to the user\u2019s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.",

As such, it logically follows the Operational Concepts document, which addresses the control of the Gemini system from a more general perspective. The impacts of the science requirements, as well as requirements of control system design are covered in this document.",
        "The users of the Gemini system are classified into the following categories. A.Astronomer. This person is using the Gemini system for the collection of science data. In a very real sense, the astronomer is the customer for the services provided by the Gemini telescopes. The astronomer has worked out, with the Gemini system, a science plan for the collection of the data. This science plan may include interactive observing; B.Science observer. This is the on-site person responsible for monitoring the data acquisition and validating the data integrity being collected for the astronomer, as well as ensuring that the science plan is functioning to the needs of the astronomer; C.Telescope Operator. The on-site controller of the telescope and instruments. This person is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the system and for keeping the system functioning accurately during observations. The Telescope Operator works with the Observer and the science plan to produce as good data as is possible; D.Support. On-site (or near-site) support personnel are responsible for the maintenance of the system, hardware and software, as well as the installation of subsystems and configuration changes; E.Developer. Developers are responsible for the designing, testing, configuring, and upgrading of subsystems; F.Administrator. Administrators are responsible for high-level functional control of the Gemini system as an integrated system. They work with other users to determine appropriate observation scheduling changes, maintenance down-time, and system modifications. It is possible that a particular individual would fall into several of the categories. For example, it is not unusual for the astronomer to also be the science observer.",
        "The Gemini system, when powered on, exists in one of several disjoint operational levels. Access to the system is restricted according to the current level of operation. The operational levels are: A.Observing level. The observing level is the \u201cnormal\u201d operational mode of the system; B.Maintenance level. Maintenance level permits access to all subsystems for routine maintenance and diagnostic work. The telescope is typically at maintenance level during daylight (non-observing) hours; C.Test level. The most primitive operational level, test level operation is used for installation/deinstallation of subsystems, including full diagnostics and installation calibration activities.",
        "At any level, but particularly during observing level operation, the software imposes on the Gemini system a series of access modes. These access modes balance ease and convenience of use against flexibility, control, and the security of the system. The access modes provided by the Gemini system are: A.Observing. This mode provides simple and safe access to the system for the collection of science data, selection of instrument parameters, and quick-look data reduction. Access to the system is through the sequencer with no direct control of telescope and instruments; B.Monitoring. This is a special, read-only case of the observing mode that can be invoked on a subsystem basis. Under no circumstances should monitoring affect the performance of an ongoing observation; C.Operation. This is the access used for direct control of the telescope and instruments, typically during observation level operation. It is normally available only to the Telescope Operator and the science program sequencer when at operation level; D.Planning. Access to the Gemini system is provided during science planning. Actual access to the telescope is not permitted in this mode, but the virtual telescope capability of the Gemini system provides a telescope simulator that is useful for planning observations, as are on-line databases; E.Testing. Test access allows full, direct control of any subsystem. All features of the subsystem are available in this mode. Under no circumstances should testing affect the performance of an ongoing observation; F.Administrative. It is possible to inquire about system utilization, efficiency, etc. using administrative access. No control is available in this mode, only status and scheduling information is accessible. Under no circumstances should administrative access affect the performance of an ongoing observation. It is entirely possible for a single user to be accessing the system through several modes simultaneously. In fact, this is the typical situation with the Telescope Operator, who is often concurrently accessing the system through the observer, monitor, and operator modes. There are times when an astronomer might be using both observer and monitor modes.",
        "Users of the system will be located at one or more facilities. These are referred to in general as Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities. The Gemini 8m Telescopes enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility are referred to collectively as the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.",

        "Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, all requirements and modes presented are intended to be available to all users of the system. It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations must fulfill all possible requirements, but it does not mean that all features will be made available to all users at all locations at all times. The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the project.",
        "Definition Observing astronomers are the end users of the system. They range greatly in experience from occasional users of the system to very experienced users such as staff astronomers at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site and service observers; Purpose of work Whatever their level of experience, observing astronomers will wish to concentrate on the efficient acquisition of astronomical data and on-line assessment of data quality, rather than on the details of controlling the telescope and instruments. To allow observing astronomers to achieve this objective, the system must offer to a user an interface which, while fulfilling the various operational requirements in the different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at any required level, is still simple to learn and secure in its use; Privileges Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope is concerned. They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time. The intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. Programs, as opposed to observers, may have the capability of direct control of the telescope. This would allow the observer to create an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount. Astronomers are typically given control access to instruments, however; Operation mode Traditional interactive operation shall normally be replaced by operation via an automatic sequencer. This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and flexible scheduling (as defined later in Section 2.7 on page 2-12). A certain degree of interaction shall be provided, meaning in this case that the user will interact with the scheduler program, rather than with the control programs directly. Observing commands will normally be submitted via the User interface to a queue for later execution. It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue. e.g. as a result of the quality assessment of previous data. In particular, Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation, but this shall not be considered as the normal operation mode for the reasons explained in Section 2.7 on page 2-12. It is evident that, for some functions (such as adjustment of spectrograph slit width for seeing conditions) it must be necessary to include interactive capability. However each instance of such a function should be examined as a candidate for automation - such as focussing. The existence of the scheduling queue shall be transparent to the on-site observer during the initial phases of telescope operation. Only after experience has been gained with the system will the existence of the queue become evident to the on site observer.",
        "Definition Currently, operations staff includes 'night assistants' and staff of the 'operations group'. Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, they may become telescope operators, operations supervisors of the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope, and instrument operators and have to overview the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation. These users will be very experienced users of the system. They will be very familiar with the Gemini 8m Telescopes and/or its instruments; Purpose of work Operations staff will control the Gemini 8m Telescopes indirectly via a scheduler program or directly via commands. They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently. They shall also monitor general performance and system safety; Privileges Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures in case of problems. This includes direct control of physical units. However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation. If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures have to be run; Operation mode Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observing astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of filters mounted on an instrument). Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument requirements in this area. They shall be able to change the operational status of units according to the results of tests performed on such units (e.g. to see if a faulty unit can be declared as operational again and redefined as part of the environment in use).",
        "Definition Software development and maintenance are staff: \u2022based either at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or base facility, or \u2022based at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility, or \u2022non Gemini staff from a contract company or from an associated Institute. These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes software works; Purpose of work Software development and maintenance staff intervene when there is a major problem to be solved or an upgrade to be installed. They also perform system generation and installation of new software packages or new releases, according to established test and validation procedures; Privileges Software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able to modify everything in the system. Nevertheless strict configuration control guidelines must be followed to prevent interference with ongoing normal operation; Operation mode Software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level (see Section 3.2.1.3 on page 3-4) for the part of the software under test. Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode to support integration tests. This means that a number of commands are available which allow the hardware concerned to be tested (test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers.",
        "This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements and speci\ufb01es the operational context, which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by: multi-telescope concept; multi-instrument context; visitors instrument context; multi-user context.",
        "Although there are two telescopes as part of the Gemini system there are no plans to support concurrent use of them as if they were a single facility. It is, however, a long term goal of the Gemini project to be capable of being used in conjunction with nearby, perhaps non-Gemini, telescopes on the same site (for instance for interferometry).",
        "Normally three scienti\ufb01c instruments are mounted on the cassegrain focus of the telescope. The Gemini 8m Telescopes are thus characterized all the time as in a multi-instrument context. Parallel access to all the mounted instruments shall be provided, though only one instrument has access to the telescope beam (active instrument).Instruments which feed two detectors by using beam splitters or \ufb01eld splitters is considered as a single active instrument. Feeding two separate instruments via beam splitters or \ufb01eld splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement. Various situations are possible for the other (inactive) instruments: they shall be able to take calibration or \ufb02at \ufb01eld exposures in parallel; they shall be able to prepare for an exposure to start as soon as the telescope beam is switched back to them (in this case, they are in a hot standby situation); they shall be able to work; at all foreseen operation levels (observing, maintenance, test) (see Section 3.2.1 on page 3-3).",
        "Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument, it shall not be possible for any of its permitted actions to adversely impact the active instrument",
        "The requirement to provide for support, installation, and operation of outside instruments brought by the observer has several implications for the system. Due to the specialized nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted. In this case a subset of the available functionality must be made available through a standardized interface. The Gemini Telescopes view all instruments as operating as servers, responding to commands from the upper levels of the system. Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported. It should be the goal of this interface that it be a subset of the existing instrumentation interface (rather than a separate system). At a minimum this interface should support: acquisition of status information of instrument by other systems; capability to enter preprogrammed observing sequences; capability to offset the telescope position and focus.",
        "It should be a goal, but not a requirement, that the interface provide support for coordinate transforms between visitor instrument and the Gemini system; archiving (or archivibility) of visitor instrument data; maintenance of operations tables (such as \ufb01lter lists) which can become part of an observation's permanent record.",
        "Due to the nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that more complicated functionality can be supported. In particular coordinated motions of the Gemini system components with those of the visitor instrument (other than simple raster scans) will not be supported. This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be possible for visitor instruments that require it. Such functionality will not be offered as a standard service but will require a joint effort on the part of Gemini and the visitor instrument team. As more complicated functionality will be supported via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments, such as coordinated motions, it should be possible to adapt visitor instruments to this standard. The dif\ufb01culty with offering such services as an externally supported standard, as opposed to an internally supported standard, is that decisions to change internal standards do not impact external users. It is important that the visitor instrument interface be stable and long-lived, as the time between successive uses of the same visitor instrument can be as long as one or two years. The support of visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the visitor equipment adheres to the Gemini standards. However it must be recognized that: the Gemini standards may not prove cost effective for some visitor instruments; the Gemini standards will evolve over time as requirements and technology change; the evolution of Gemini standards might require existing visitor instruments to rewrite or rework large areas of their control system; visitor instruments built later in time than the initial complement of Gemini instruments may want to take advantage of different and/or less expensive technology if it better suits the goals of their project.",
        "For these reasons it is probably not possible to establish a combined standard to which all instruments, both Gemini and visitor, adhere to completely. It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be made available to visitor instruments via long lived, stable interfaces. Visitor requirements outside of these would be handled on an as needed basis. The support of both Gemini and visitor instruments would bene\ufb01t by the provision of a Gemini observatory simulator. This simulator, appearing to the instrument as a standard set of hardware and software interfaces, would present a functional de\ufb01nition of the observatory",
        "The requirements to have instruments operated as single units imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 8m Telescopes. On these user stations, different kinds of users may be working at the same time with the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. Independently of the location of users at the telescope site, they shall be able to access (according to their privileges) any part of the whole setup with a simple logon and con\ufb01guration operation. In other words. any subsection of the whole Gemini 8m Telescopes system should be accessible and controllable from any single point (but of course with protection ensuring security and safety). A particularly simple case of multi-use of the system is multi-point monitoring. By this it is meant that, while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, someone else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and instruments. This will typically be needed by the operation supervisor. All other users wishing to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by Operations and get permission to do so. The multi-point monitoring mode might also be important when certain dif\ufb01cult or rare problems occur, when expert advice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely. Multi-point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and investigate how the system is working (e.g. by selecting different display pages with the up-to-date status information on different parts of the system). Multi-point monitoring also allows a local observer to be monitored and advised by a remote supervisor. Monitoring shall exist both in the form of automatic displays of status information at different locations, and in the form of explicit access to the required status information from any point. Monitoring shall not affect the performance of ongoing observations.",
        "The different observing modes (interactive, queue-based, remote-operations and service) impose constraints on software design.",
        "Requirements: .Normally executed with the sequencer by providing a computer executable program, in order to make ef\ufb01cient use of the Gemini telescope; .Interactive operation is supported, but always through the Observatory Control System (OCS); .There is a visual user interface to the OCS to allow for changes to the viewing program; It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing.",
        "Interactive observing with time allocation for full nights is a \ufb01rst basic requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes. It is therefore an essential requirement that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way in this mode. Interaction will normally be via an automatic sequencer (see Section 2.5.9 on page 2-6). This is clearly a top priority requirement and one which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode. The initial implementation of the automatic sequencer will operate in a \u201cpass through\u201dmode where all commands are accepted and transmitted with minimal checking and delay.",
        "Queue-based observing is the primary observation mode used with the Gemini telescopes, as it is the best means of providing sound science data while maximizing ef\ufb01cient use of the telescope. While its requirements include all those given below for service observing, it has the following special requirements. The observing program must be fully automated, requiring very little human interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include a suf\ufb01ciently rich programming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to the astronomer; There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer to test observing programs for completeness, errors, and functionality. This simulator should function within the virtual telescope environment of the Gemini system; All control software must provide support for simulated use within the virtual telescope; There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both within an observing program and across observing programs, in order to optimize observing ef\ufb01ciency. This software must consider target positions, weather conditions, and instrument con\ufb01gurations; There must be software to support the \ufb02exible scheduling, both manually and via a scheduler, allowing for the interleaving of observing programs in a manner that is transparent to the individual observing programs. This includes managing the collection of science, environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data; To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments. These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences. It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue. This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences, current site conditions, and other rules established by the observatory directorate.While these rules have yet to be worked out one could imagine rules such as \u201cno more than 15% of observing will be preempted\u201d or \u201ca 10% overhead to the prime observing project is acceptable in order to pick up observations in similar parts of the sky with identical \ufb01lters\u201d.",
        "Thus queue scheduling is a superset of preprogrammed observing, with similar requirements. As the costs of implementing such a scheduler are currently dif\ufb01cult to estimate it may prove necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project. The system design, if it does not include a scheduler, should speci\ufb01cally allow for its future implementation.",
        "Remote operations includes both remote observing, with the science observer offsite, and remote telescope operation, with control of the telescope also off- site. It also covers remote eavesdropping, monitoring, con\ufb01guration, and diagnosis. (There will always be support staff on-site during observations, however.) The requirements for supporting remote operations are: All software should be developed to permit remote operations. There should be no conceptual difference between software working on-site and remotely; All observing facilities should work both on-site and off-site. It should be possible to do full operations remotely; Team observing, with multiple observers at different sites should be supported; It must be possible to restrict speci\ufb01c operations to speci\ufb01c remote sites. For example, at the Mauna Kea site, remote telescope control might be restricted to Hale Pohaku. The method used to restrict such operations should be independent of the operations themselves, and dynamic; It is assumed that the hardware involved in remote operations has been speci\ufb01ed with suf\ufb01cient bandwidth to support remote operations. However, we will take advantage of commercially available protocols such as ISDN, TCP/IP, Internet, etc.",
        "The choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of operations, such as remote observing but also remote access for diagnostic support. In this sense it is more general than pure remote observing. Despite the obvious limitations introduced by the link bandwidths available at the different locations, the system shall be totally transparent to local or remote use. It is only necessary that the functionality of the system be transparent, it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system. However the system design should minimize the impact of link bandwidth on transparency. Security of operation shall be considered and might imply different operation levels and privileges at different sites. It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design, to avoid redesign later. This should reduce the amount of speci\ufb01c software needed for remote operations, as the common layers of software shall cope from the beginning with a distributed environment.",
        "Remote control means that the function normally associated with a local Telescope Operator, that of entering telescope control commands, would be available from a remote site. In practice remote control will be restricted to the Gemini 8m Telescopes Enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes Control Facility. The philosophy behind this is that, for safety considerations, telescope control commands cannot be issued without a staff member (not necessarily the same person) having direct access to: a hard wired \u201cstop\u201d button; real time video and audio; control of the telescope.",
        "Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a remote site such as Cerro Tololo, Hilo or even home Institutes. This possibility has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes. The extent to which realistic observing conditions can be reproduced depends, of course, largely on the link bandwidth available. Experience with previous telescopes at other OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS observatories shows, however, that, even with very limited bandwidths, remote observing can be implemented, provided the software is suitable for this. Remote observing, as meant in this context, does not mean remote control. Remote users shall normally interact with the system via operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility; operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site facility; operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facility; operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility; via the scheduler program and shall not control any part of the Gemini 8m Telescopes directly.",
        "In the last case they will use a remote User interface to submit commands to the Gemini 8m Telescopes scheduler at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.",
        "In this mode the monitor's screen appears as a duplicate of that seen by the observer. The monitor's keyboard would not have any effect on the observer's environment",
        "Remote monitoring is the simplest level of remote observing. It is sometimes called 'eavesdropping'. It is a requirement for the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation and will complement service observing, making it friendlier for users. Remote monitoring coincides to a large extent with multipoint monitoring, but allows the remote user to \u201cpick and choose\u201d the information that is displayed on the remote screen. There is no requirement that the remote screen be a duplicate of the local screen. The remote keyboard will have no effect on the local user's environment. A remote observer might also need a real-time video and voice link with the operator in the control room, perhaps using a portable video camera which the operator can position as necessary. It is assumed this facility is provided entirely by hardware, and is beyond the scope of the Gemini software.",
        "Quite apart from remote observing, remote access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes and its instruments is required for monitoring and diagnostic purposes. This might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems. Remote access, in this case, must be possible from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facility. Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software, once implemented. also allows, without extra requirements, local access (at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site) or remote access (Gemini 8m Telescopes support, base, and remote operations facilities).",
        "Service observing implies that the Gemini staff are responsible for performing the actual data collection for the astronomer. A special case of service observing, queue-based, is given earlier, and assumes that the observing program can be executed with minimal interaction with the client astronomer. The more general case, where a science observer is present on site and the client astronomer is remotely connected, is considered here. The requirements speci\ufb01c to service observing are: The observing program must be automated, requiring little human interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include a suf\ufb01ciently rich programming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to the astronomer; This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer, for developing the program, and to the observer, for review and adjustment of the program. This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment; The programming environment should allow for the communication of special notes, instructions, and comments from the astronomer to the observer, possibly involving multimedia techniques. The use of this feature would, however, be discouraged for queue-based observing.",
        "Observing, as such, is the purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. But interactive observing is perhaps, in some cases, not the most ef\ufb01cient way to achieve this, although it will be necessary for certain kinds of observations (such as adaptive optics) and in certain phases (such as commissioning and test periods). Service observing, on the other hand, means that the observing program can be performed by someone other than the proposing astronomer. It will be done on his behalf at a convenient moment that is not exactly prede\ufb01ned and may be intermixed with programs from other users. Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments. This might typically be a few times (2) per night, when sky conditions change. It requires also that the observing program is so well speci\ufb01ed that it can be executed by someone else. In other words, it requires a computer executable observing program. Service observing requires a suitable organization to support it, and \ufb01rst of all, considerable experience with a smooth running system. For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been ful\ufb01lled and been in operation for a while. Nevertheless, the software and data structures to support classical observing which have to be present in a system that is only interactive at the start might require considerable redesign to be adapted later to the service observing requirement",
        "To achieve ef\ufb01cient service observing, queue observing, and \ufb02exible scheduling, it should be possible to carry out observations automatically, in accordance with prede\ufb01ned sequences of exposures, as is commonly done in space observatories. This corresponds to what is meant by planned observing, which still requires competent monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely. At the same time, one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra \ufb02exibility of ground-based astronomy. So whichever scheme is adopted to perform automatic sequences, interaction shall be allowed at the desired level (for example, only on error conditions, any time the user is allowed to break a sequence, etc.).",
        "Flexible scheduling means the possibility of reacting to changes in weather and other conditions by allocating the current use of the telescope to the optimal observing program for those conditions. It will require the use of service and/or remote observing, as users cannot stay around inde\ufb01nitely waiting for the conditions required by their program. This can be complemented by remote monitoring, if users can be on standby at a suitably equipped remote site. Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly, exchanging observing programs. This can be achieved only with the help of appropriate scheduling software, which must advise the operations team on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the various observing programs. It should be recognized that such \u2018expert scheduling\u2019 software does not currently exist - it should be a requirement of such software that it have an operational mode which merely supports the decision making process by presenting appropriate information. Flexible scheduling requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments (typically 2 times per night). Thus \ufb02exible scheduling is a superset of queue scheduling, with similar requirements.",
        "These requirements apply to the commands and replies between sub-systems (including status information requests and replies), information \ufb02ow to and from on-line databases, and commands and software for the IOCs.",
        "The syntax of control \ufb02ow commands is to be consistent across the system, whether accessing workstation software or IOC software. See Section 3.2.5 on page 3-6; All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands to test operational status, inquiries as to version, perform self-tests, etc. These common commands are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2. All IOC subsystems must respond to additional common commands for such activities as start, stop, initialize, reset parameters, etc. These IOC common commands are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2; The support structure for communicating commands must be reliable, with a uniform ACK/NAK protocol adopted across all systems. Timeouts must be supported at approximately 500 msec; Handshaking of commands between IOCs must occur within 100-200 msec, signaling acceptance of each command; For commands allowing delayed replies, timeouts for that reply must also be supported; Peak control information within the system is expected to be 100 TPS. This assumes bridging between communication sections, to isolate traf\ufb01c in relevant sections only.",
        "The following requirements apply to the control and transfer of astronomical data in all forms (science, engineering, reference, etc.)",
        "Data \ufb02ow. Data from detectors must be stored in the most effective method permitted by available technology. Astronomical data is often detector readout limited so that disk access and data transfer times are not signi\ufb01cant. Maximum acceptable readout time for detector data is very dependent on detector type and size as well as the intended application:; For focusing and related activities, maximum acceptable detector readout time is about 0.1 sec, though only a portion of the detector may be read during that time; For mosaicked, large optical detectors, a full readout of the detector must be done in about 2 or 3 minutes. Concurrent data access and display. Since the Gemini system supports monitoring of operation, there must be the capability of providing multiple, simultaneous access to data. Data transfer between the virtual telescope system and attached workstations therefore imposes signi\ufb01cant transfer requirements on the LAN. The LAN must support a transfer rate of 20-40 Mbits/second; Data acquisition format. Data is normally acquired as uncompressed data, but may be compressed using a loss-less compression technique for transmission from the Gemini system or across the system LAN. The goal of compression is to minimize bandwidth impact on the LAN and WAN and to save space on removable media. For data that requires preprocessing, such as infrared detector data, only the preprocessed data is stored; Storage of data. Data from all instruments and detectors is stored as compressed data, using a standard format. There is a \ufb01rst level of storage within IOCs, to secure data in the event of link failures.A second level of storage is on the Gemini system data disk(s), possibly also on removable media. Quick-look data quality assessment is done using this level. Archiving of data is automatically done while in observing and maintenance level operation to the Gemini Archive subsystem. Shipping of data to a central archive follows later; Data transmission format. Data is transmitted between Gemini and home Institutes using a FITS format and contains all header information provided with the data; System-wide data capacity. The data capacity of the system is limited by transfer methods and technology, as well as archiving capacity on site. The system data capacity is capable of retaining 7 days of data produced by the largest instrument, the last 3 days of which must be available interactively from hard disk or similar medium.",
        "Video information originates from target acquisition, guiding, and site monitoring cameras. The requirements for transferring video data are: The system must allow for fast transmission of rough images every 0.5 sec. This may be assisted through the use of data-loss compression techniques (e.g. JPEG, MPEG, etc); In addition, there is the need for transmission of images matching the original resolution. This high-quality transmission must require less than 20 sec, and can only be assisted with loss-less compression.",
        "To preserve the integrity of the system, there must be a system of privileges established at each operating level of the system. These privileges should be determined in a simple manner during logging into the system. Protection against accidental interference is to be implemented using an Access Mode Allocation system that dynamically identi\ufb01es and assigns resources as needed. Critical resources (those that can support only a restricted number of simultaneous uses) are assigned solely through this allocation system. The allocation system must ensure that the system cannot remain deadlocked with respect to this resource allocation. Finally, procedures must be implemented for convenience and system integrity, to simplify and codify common tasks. The tasks that require such procedures include: Telescope start-up and shutdown; Telescope system self-testing; Instrument start-up and shut-down. This is not permitted to interfere with telescope operation; Instrument self-testing and self-diagnosis This is not permitted to interfere with telescope operation; Con\ufb01guration and recon\ufb01guration; Dynamic recon\ufb01guration of observing con\ufb01guration (beam switching without restarting instruments and telescope); The control software should know what subsystems are installed and their status at all times.",
        "The telescope and instrument software shall contain built-in test (BIT) facilities to verify Gemini 8m Telescopes system and Gemini 8m Telescopes software performances. Every Gemini 8m Telescopes software module shall have corresponding test speci\ufb01cations to check normal operation of releases, to be used both for acceptance tests and as an on-line test procedure. The Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall also provide for execution of self-test sequences of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system and subsystems. These shall automatically exercise all subsystems present in a given operational con\ufb01guration. Regression tests should be a part of every Gemini 8m Telescopes software package",
        "Subsystems must notify the user when faults occur. This noti\ufb01cation must be speci\ufb01c as to origin and problem. The noti\ufb01cation must also be capable of being electronically logged. It may also prove useful to have multiple levels of fault noti\ufb01cation such as detailed, verbose, short, etc. to aid in tracking down problems.",
        "Should a subsystem fail (e.g. one detector, one instrument) prede\ufb01ned procedures must exist to rede\ufb01ne the environment in such a way that operation can restart with the remaining equipment. In case of computer hardware failure concerning the user station equipment, it shall be possible to transfer control from one user station to another via a simple software recon\ufb01guration procedure. In the case of IOC failure, no transfer of control to another IOC will be possible, due to the local connections and interfaces to the control electronics. In this case there shall be a procedure to replace faulty cards and/or assemblies. If it is possible to observe with that particular IOC in a failed state (in general, this is limited to IOCs that are associated with individual scienti\ufb01c instruments) then it must be possible to recon\ufb01gure the system to do so.",
        "Full redundancy is not a requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes and it will be acceptable to have to replace units in case of failure. There are subsystems which are relatively inexpensive to support as redundant systems, such as telescope control computers. For each area where redundancy is decided to be cost effective, procedures for switching to the backup system will be established. There is no requirement for automatic switching to the backup system. All communication shall be based on the use of standard communication protocols, where retry procedures are applied (a form of software redundancy) as part of the protocol. Certain network concepts may be preferable as they offer intrinsic redundancy (e.g. double loops) and re-routing possibilities in case of node failures (single point failure protection).",
        "The Gemini system software is designed under the following constraints.",
        ".There should be no restrictions imposed by the software on users. Only policy decisions (permissions, access privileges, etc.) should prevent any user from accessing any part of the Gemini system from any local or remote station; .Similar functionality should be presented to the users using similar user interfaces. However, user interfaces should clearly re\ufb02ect access modes and operating levels.",
        "Hardware constraints are covered in the individual chapters the Software Design Description.",
        "There are a number of general constraints placed on the Gemini Software. These are: Commercial packages, off-the-shelf public domain software, and standards are to be used whenever feasible; Existing external software will be integrated with the Gemini software. The interfaces involved in this integration are considered part of the Gemini software system; All Gemini software is to be developed using standard methodologies and development environments. One of the goals of Gemini software is that all components be easily (preferably automatically) combined into an integrated system; Gemini software developers should maintain accurate change logs showing software modi\ufb01cations as they are applied to the system software; Gemini software developers should adhere to a standard method for the reporting and recording of errors from both internal and external sources; Gemini software should be developed in evolutionary fashion, using the CVS version control system; All Gemini subsystem packages should include as part of the software both a simulator module for inclusion in the virtual telescope (see Design constraints, below), and user interface modules for the user interface environments that the subsystem will be operating in. The interfaces required of these user interface modules are described in Section 3.3 on page 3-6; All Gemini software is to be fully documented, internally with appropriate comments, and external documentation. External documentation must include Unix-style man pages; All Gemini subsystem packages must provide modules for the testing and diagnosis of the subsystem; All instrumentation control software must provide full access to all instrument functionality. It is likely that different user interface modules (see above) would present different portions of this functionality to the user. The information required of each interface module is found in the Functional Requirements speci\ufb01cations for each instrument; All Gemini software must be version labeled, both in source and binary form. The version information is to be retrievable from executing software via control commands.",
        ".There are different requirements for software running on different layers. For example, strict real-time control is restricted to the IOC layer; Also, the use of a virtual-telescope model in the Gemini system means that the integrated system can be tested and developed independently of the target hardware. This is useful not only in the use of the telescope simulator during science planning, but in maintenance and testing as well. Therefore all hardware subsystems must provide a software simulation module (as stated earlier) that responds in reasonable fashion to commands directed at that hardware. This simulation may require a standard environment, such as VxWorks, EPICS, and VME crate/cpu, but it cannot require any hardware speci\ufb01c to the application; .Gemini subsystem should be as self-contained and autonomous as possible, thereby decreasing the functional width of the interface to the rest of the Gemini system; No subsystem package should make any assumptions about the surrounding environment beyond that provided in the interface speci\ufb01cations.",
        "The \ufb01nal purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes software is the acquisition of astronomical data in digital form in the most ef\ufb01cient way. To achieve this, many other data concerning the telescope and instruments (parameters) and control commands will have to be exchanged between different processing units in order to setup and control telescope and instruments. Additionally, video and voice data are also necessary (for example, \ufb01eld monitors).",
        "Control information must be transferred, typically in the form of commands and replies from users, to telescope and instruments. Replies might contain status information and, in general, data concerning instruments and telescopes, to be stored together with the astronomical data. Control information on all controlled variables must be provided by all subsystems on request. No request for information shall produce a delay of control activities or locking, even if the corresponding equipment is not available or faulty. Delay times for the exchange of control information must stay within precise time limits to be de\ufb01ned in \u201cGeneral Description\u201d in Chapter 2. One can afford to retransmit commands in case of transmission error or collision, but the protocol has to be predictable in that commands cannot get lost and replies have to come back reliably. In a number of cases, synchronization with the Time Reference System at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site is also necessary. Access to control parameters, telescope and instrument information for monitoring or other use makes a signi\ufb01cant contribution to the control \ufb02ow, and may be logged at quite high rates for short periods (i.e. up to 200 Hz for some information). It is explicitly required that all such information is available to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software and is capable of being available to all users of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, subject only to restrictions with respect to updating. It must also be possible to restrict user access to such information. In particular also, the meteorological information coming from a weather station should be available centrally.",
        "Detector data must be acquired and stored in the most effective way technology will allow; effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of cost, space requirements, longevity, and speed. This shall lead to the de\ufb01nition of a Gemini 8m Telescopes standard, used on all instruments. In general, operational overheads must be kept as low as possible, to maximize actual observing times. Intermediate storage of raw data in memory on different nodes and in different formats should be kept to a minimum. However, there must be at least two copies - one to secure data as acquired and one to do assessment of data quality on-line (this last copy preferably on removable media). The link chosen to transfer data should represent as small a bottleneck as possible for data acquisition.",
        "Normally, raw data will be acquired and stored as such for quick look evaluations. There might, however, be cases (for example, infrared detectors) where fast preprocessing is needed and where, therefore, raw data will not be stored as such, but in a preprocessed format.",
        "Astronomical data will have to be transported between GEMINI and the home institutes of visiting astronomers in FITS format (as de\ufb01ned by NOST 100-1.0, \u201cDe\ufb01nition of the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)\u201d, NASA Science Of\ufb01ce of Standards and Technology).",
        "TV data concerning site monitoring and voice need to be capable of being available at all operations facilities. It will be a question of interfacing and bandwidth costs whether such information is actually available at a speci\ufb01c location. It is not a requirement that point to point video be available between Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities. It is a requirement that voice connectivity, perhaps point to point, be available on a permanent connection. Other astronomical information such as that coming from sky \ufb01eld monitors, autoguider cameras and sky monitoring devices such as cloud and seeing monitors shall also be capable of being available.",
        "Operation of telescope, instruments and subsystems can be carried out at three different levels. There will be parameters associated with each level of operation which de\ufb01ne the status of the system and / or control the system. The speci\ufb01c access by different types of users to particular parameters of the different levels are given in Section 2.5.8 on page 25.",
        "This is the normal operational mode. It allows a certain number of embedded tests, normally at a fairly high level. Monitoring is also done at this level. It is anticipated that all user categories have access to this level.",
        "This allows maintenance tables (for example, with instrument parameters) to be updated. It is anticipated that the majority of parameters at this level will be accessed by operations and development staff.",
        "This allows the installation and testing of new packages or new releases. Any low level test can be performed in this mode. It shall be possible to update all non-protected parameter values, i.e. those not used by operations at observing level. Access to this level will be extremely limited.",
        "Privileges and protections are also important parameters to de\ufb01ne user operations.",
        "A further subdivision within the levels can be achieved by implementing privileges associated with categories of users or with the location of the user station (local or remote). For example some users might only be allowed monitoring, as a subsystem is in use by someone else.",
        "Protections must also be enforced (see also Security in Section 3.5.6 on page 3- 20) among users and the operational software should indicate clearly to users the current operation level and check the compatibility between subsystems in different modes.",
        "The capacity of the system can be expressed in terms of nodes, which is de\ufb01ned as the number of workstations, or in terms of users, which is de\ufb01ned as the sum total of users at all the nodes. The capacity requirements will be expressed in terms of nodes. Each node will have the capability to run at all operation levels. When the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope is used in its normal observing mode, there will be a single operator node for the telescope and two data acquisition and instrument control nodes. OPERATION Some tests might be run in parallel on instruments that do not have the light beam at that moment, so in principle additional nodes might be working at the same time. The system will provide for one auxiliary data acquisition and instrument control nodes. In addition, the system must support off-site observing modes. The system will provide for a single off-site data acquisition and instrument control node - to be located at either the Gemini 8m Telescopes Site Support or Base Facility. One supervisor will monitor the system, and other users might need to monitor the running of observing programs, locally or remotely. The system will provide for a single local monitoring node and a single remote monitoring node. As a conclusion, the Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall allow simultaneous operation of up to six active control nodes and up to two more monitoring nodes (one local and one remote) without appreciable degradation of performance. In practice the operation and facilities foreseen so far for the Gemini 8m Telescopes will limit this number to a maximum in the order of three active nodes, but the Gemini 8m Telescopes computers and software shall be capable of coping with the load of 10 active nodes, should the case arise",
        "This section is intentionally kept at the level of performance criteria rather than response times (found in Section 2.11.2 on page 2- 22). Every command must be acknowledged in a positive or negative way before the occurrence of the corresponding action within given response times.",
        "There must be automatic procedures to implement startup and shutdown of the telescope and instruments. These must allow startup and shutdown of instruments independently of the telescope and without affecting the telescope operation. Recon\ufb01guration procedures must exist, to change the observing environment. The de\ufb01nition of the observing environments must be dynamic, i.e. feasible during operations without the need to restart everything. The same applies to the related light path. Operations staff have privileges to change the environment, meaning selecting a suitable combination of instrumentsThe operational software should know which subsystems are installed and operational at any given time.",
        "The user interface de\ufb01nes the way users see the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. Given the large number of instruments, there can be many different stations which are active at the same time. It is essential for operational and maintenance reasons that, in spite of the obvious differences of the setups and commands available, the same philosophy is applied throughout. This calls for a homogeneous user interface, which can be achieved only by applying the same user interface tools to the whole project, providing the Gemini 8m Telescopes user interface's \u2018look and feel\u2019. The user interface should not be seen as a package linked to a speci\ufb01c computer. Given the requirement to be able to access the Gemini 8m Telescopes from several points, the user interface should rather be seen as a package to be callable from a large number of stations, depending on where a user is. It should also be network transparent so that it does not matter where it is being run. The user interface tools shall be based on standards, de\ufb01ned in Section 4.2.5 on page 4- 7, which will be portable across different computer hardware platforms (Portable User Interface Toolkit). The intent of a portability requirement is to facilitate migrating existing and future Gemini systems to different hardware as the need arises. It is the current intent to limit the selection of computer hardware platforms to as few as is practical",
        "Main processor computer hardware requirements will be de\ufb01ned in the Hardware constraints (see Section 3.4.2 on page 3- 12). This section deals instead with external hardware interfaces, namely the ones from the microprocessors to the control electronics. The de\ufb01nition of these terms is as follows: main processors - these are the computers with which the user interacts; control electronics - these are the computers controlling the instruments; microprocessors - these are computers embedded in the instrument (for instance a DSP or transputer required for array control functions, or special purpose controllers for the primary mirror support actuators).",
        "Standard interfaces to the control electronics shall be available, in the form of: standard bus systems; a standard set of interface cards to be used on all the subsystems and instruments; a standard software skeleton running on the control electronics.",
        "The existence of hardware standards is clearly essential for maintenance and repairs. It is also essential to avoid software duplication, and to simplify the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. Microprocessor software in particular tends to contain hardware speci\ufb01c software, though one should try to keep it as hardware independent as possible, isolating different software layers. The standard software must be adequate for the real-time requirements and must offer drivers to the standard electronics to be used on all the Gemini 8m Telescopes software subsystems and instruments. Links between electronics interfaces and main processors must meet the requirements imposed by the data speci\ufb01cations (see Section 3.1 on page 3- 1).",
        "The Gemini 8m Telescopes software covers all aspects of control and data acquisition related to the telescope, instruments, and auxiliary instrumentation. It also covers all the operational aspects of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, including on-line scheduling and rescheduling. There is also software which, although it will be interfaced to the Gemini 8m Telescopes, is referred to as external. The external software consists of: commercial software integrated into the Gemini 8m Telescopes software (e.g. DBMS); preexisting software used in the Gemini 8m Telescopes (e.g. image processing systems, star catalogues); software associated with visitor instrumentation; embedded software dedicated to hardware control, but not communicating on-line with the other Gemini 8m Telescopes software (in general this would be microprocessor code).",
        "The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must interface to the external software and clearly the interfaces are fully part of the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.",
        "In order to make ef\ufb01cient use of the telescope, to support different observing modes, and to support the versatility requirements, some form of on-line image (or pixel) quick-look analysis is required. The following statements are proposed: \u201cIt shall be possible to monitor the quality (image quality, spectral resolution, signal to noise, etc.) of the astronomical data as it comes in. Standard reduction procedures should be available for basic on-line calibrations of the observed data. Ultimately, one would like to have fully reduced and calibrated data at the end of the observations. Advanced pipeline procedures might make this feasible, at least for observations of a standard nature.\u201d.",
        "The above statements de\ufb01ne the goal of quick-look analysis for the Gemini 8m Telescopes. Quick-look data processing should be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, with procedures suitable for fast on-line data preprocessing. A prerequisite for this is that acquired data are made available as directly as possible in a common format, and that all additional data related to an exposure and logging information are made available on-line at the same time. Quick-look should be usable within exposure sequences to provide results and feedback parameters to the control software in a programmed way, without the need for manual intervention. This document does not try to be speci\ufb01c about the requirements for Quick-look other than that it should be synchronous. Near-line processing should be available for simple data reductions required for data integrity validation (i.e. remove instrument and observatory effects so the observer can make decisions about further observing actions). This data reduction proceeds sequentially through requests, but asynchronously from data acquistion. In particular, data acquisition takes precedence over near-line data reduction. Off-line pixel processing for full data reduction should also exist at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, but does not have any interface to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. The Astronomical communities have made considerable investments in image processing software, and therefore, compatibility with and adaptations to these packages must be sought. EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS It should also be noted that some Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystems, such as adaptive optics, may require their own special on-line pixel processing software, which is better de\ufb01ned in the requirements for those subsystems. This is largely due to the dif\ufb01culty of applying on-line the same algorithms used for full off-line reductions \u2014 in general due to the time critical nature of the image processing needs. The same situation might also occur with other instruments, where speci\ufb01c observer support software has to be foreseen for on-line use. In all these cases the speci\ufb01c on-line (quick-look) software development shall be seen as a subset of the development for the off-line data reduction system, to avoid as far as possible duplication of development effort.",
        "The output format of the Gemini 8m Telescopes data must be compatible with the GEMINI archive requirements. As comparisons with previous data might be of great value and affect the actual observing program, on-line interactive access to the data archiving system should exist, so that access to this database is possible for Gemini 8m Telescopes users. The speci\ufb01c types of data available; \ufb02at \ufb01elds, calibrations, science exposures, etc.; the amount of a speci\ufb01c exposure available; header only, averaged exposure, complete raw data set; and the time frame within which such data will be made available; same night, weekly, after proprietary period; will be established by the Gemini Archiving Requirements. Computer access to star catalogues is also required, so that an automatic selection of candidate guide and standard stars can be made.",
        "The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must be able to interface with all commercial software packages available on the Gemini 8m Telescopes and integrated into the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation. A relevant example of such a package is a general database management system (DBMS), where operational information such as schedules, logs, problem reports and maintenance information related to various pieces of equipment should be kept.Being in itself a distributed telescope system and having a large number of instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes system has internal communication needs",
        "Being in itself a distributed telescope system and having a large number of instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes system has internal communication needs.",
        "The LAN shall support the majority of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system internal communication needs. This LAN must be capable of dealing both with the data bandwidths required (at peak and on average) and with the required response times and synchronization needs. This LAN shall be supplemented with a Local Time Bus, for distribution of absolute and relative time signals, and both a digital re\ufb02ective memory bus and an analog event-based bus, for distribution of signals with requirements not satis\ufb01ed by a LAN. Independently of the physical layout of such a network, its functional requirements can be split into several categories: Local coordination and synchronization needs within a subsystem (for example, coordination of active support system for primary mirror, bi-directional traf\ufb01c of commands/replies). This layer could be considered as internal to a given subsystem or instrument, but as more than one subsystem might need it, one should aim for a unique solution at the hardware and software level; Global synchronization needs, such as the universal time synchronization requirement. The required accuracy will be de\ufb01ned in Section 2.9 on page 2- 19; Exchange of control information, in the form of commands and status information. (Bi-directional traf\ufb01c) (see also Section 3.1.1 on page 3- 1). \u2022Collection and transfer (for archiving or remote access) of raw astronomical; Access from Wide Area Network (WAN) for remote diagnostics and monitoring from operations facilities (Bi-directional traf\ufb01c).",
        "No distinction is made here between WAN and point to point links as there shall be no difference in the software between the two cases. However the system architecture will be designed so as to minimize the communication load placed on peer and higher level networks. Control data and astronomical data have already been de\ufb01ned in the Data speci\ufb01cations (see Section 3.1 on page 3- 1). The reason for repeating them here is to have a complete view of the required network functionality.To eliminate conceptual access problems, while coping with different bandwidths, LAN and WAN interfaces shall be homogeneous and shall be based on standards which allow migration on different media, should they become required during the Gemini 8m Telescopes project life. For maintenance reasons and hardware independence, a clear hierarchical model must be implemented, supporting separation of logical and physical layers, e.g. ISO/OSI model. It is recognized that this hierarchy may need to be violated for (in general) performance reasons. This results in point-to-point connections between peer systems or direct connections bypassing the hierarchy. Network redundancy should also be considered in the design phase as a way to increase reliability and security, in particular for control information. Due to the uncertain future of the Internet, only non-essential tasks may employ it. All essential tasks, not including remote observing, must take place on resources controlled by the project (such as leased lines). Violation of the hierarchical nature of the system can lead to testing and maintenance problems. The use of these features must be limited and constrained by the following guidelines: Peer-to-peer connectivity should only be used to overcome a demonstrated performance problem; Bypassing the hierarchy (connected between grandmother and granddaughter with no path through the mother) should only be used for transmission of status information or bulk data, not control \ufb02ow.",
        "It is envisaged that observing astronomers who have travelled to the Gemini 8m Telescopes site will make use of the Gemini 8m Telescopes control room facilities. This will allow centralized support and coordination of their operations, providing both operations support for individual instruments and supervision for all of them. However, even at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site there will be users (e.g. software development and maintenance staff) installing or enhancing other parts of the system, possibly working directly at the telescope. Finally, in the case of remote operations, other users (e.g. support staff) might be on Cerro Tololo or in Hilo. To allow coordination both locally at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site between the various users and with remote users, the software shall support access to the system from any user station. It will then be an operational decision, implying privileges and priorities for the various categories of users, and de\ufb01nition of what a given user can actually do. Access from any user station will make user stations in principle identical and software con\ufb01gurable as the user station of this or that subsystem. This should greatly simplify the coordination problem posed by the large number of simultaneous users (as already described in the Capacity requirements, Section 3.2.2).",
        "There are a number of constraints for the Gemini 8m Telescopes computer hardware. Although some of these constraints may appear redundant the project recognizes that: during the next 5 to 10 years new hardware will be available with features and costs that could bene\ufb01t the project; the hardware chosen as the standard at this point of time may be no longer available at some point in the future; the cost of maintaining an existing hardware standard, even if available, may exceed the costs of adopting a new hardware standard.",
        "These constraints recognize that the majority of the expense in changing hardware standards is the cost of the software. Particular constraints are: Computers used at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, particularly in the test phase when they are outside the control room and near the subsystem under test, shall be checked against altitude and humidity speci\ufb01cations for the Gemini 8m Telescopes site (see also [EDS] in Section 1.3); Computer hardware must be able to run the Gemini 8m Telescopes software environment (operating systems, Gemini 8m Telescopes software) and provide compatibility in data format (identical internal data representation); .Common development and implementation tools must be both available and supported; Identical network access must be supported; .Local processing power must be such that telescope and instrument control does not represent a signi\ufb01cant overhead in the whole process of executing an observing program (the overhead, if any, should be limited by the time it takes for physical devices to act); The choice of a scalable hardware architecture with computers at various performance levels should solve the problem of adequate on-line data assessment, as the amount of this activity is very variable and dependent upon the kind of detector and method used; .Due to the limited bandwidths which may be available remotely, there will be constraints on the functionality of remote operations and access.",
        "Depending on funding, it is probably reasonable here to make a minimum and a desirable speci\ufb01cation. The minimum situation could also coincide with what is needed in the test period before coming to full remote operation. In any case, remote operation must include remote monitoring from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities, together with access tools for diagnostic and test use. It should be a goal to support remote observing from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities.",
        "Some of the general requirements which have a direct effect on the software are here explicitly transformed into software constraints. These are: Individual instruments must be able to run fully independently; Telescope software at the two telescopes must be maintained to be identical in the upper layers (even if hardware should differ); Additions of new instruments should aim, as a goal, at introducing no modi\ufb01cation to already operational parts. Modi\ufb01cations should be con\ufb01ned to the operational procedures and should not affect the bulk of the existing software; .Switching to different con\ufb01gurations must be possible at any time with appropriate procedures; There must be easy procedures to recon\ufb01gure the system when subsystems are modi\ufb01ed or removed; The number of main packages of software must be kept to a minimum to facilitate maintenance, but compatibly with the need to have the right degree of modularity; Commercial and public domain packages should be used whenever possible; Existing software packages should be reused wherever possible; Existing software expertise should be consulted whenever possible; All software which does not directly control speci\ufb01c hardware must be written as machine independent, portable code. Even for microprocessor software, the software should be hardware independent, to allow a later choice of the target microprocessors; To allow for expansion and maintenance, Gemini 8m Telescopes standards must be de\ufb01ned for the on-line software and the development environment; On-line version control must be implemented. That is, the version control system must be available to recover/restore versions at all times; .At boot time, the Gemini 8m Telescopes software shall check the consistency of versions of all the various software components; .Table-driven software should be used whenever possible, to avoid unnecessary compilations.",
        "Whether the software is table driven, message driven, or a combination of both is a function of the individual work packages and de\ufb01ned in the appropriate work package description. Changing system constants, such as arcseconds/bit for an encoder, shall not require recompiling but will be updated as part of system startup, and, for some constants, will be modi\ufb01able during operation. System status parameters will be maintained to an extent that will allow restarting the system and regaining the previous state. The extent of duplication of the previous state will be dictated by safety and practical considerations. Strict checking should be applied on this to preserve maintainability and recon\ufb01guration of the system.",

The [GSR] sets as a requirement 2% and a goal 1% for total system (mechanical, electrical, and software) downtime due to failures - this translates to a maximum of 15 minutes per night or 1 night per month of downtime. This in turn sets quite stringent requirements on both MTBF and MTTR for the software and controls. To guarantee maximum availability of the control system, retry procedures must be embodied in the software in case of error or failure (e.g. time-out, hardware failure) to achieve recovery on-line whenever possible. Should recovery also fail, the error or failure has to be reported in a clear form (to identify the cause of the problem) and the system shall put itself into a safe state, whenever a safety aspect might be involved. To avoid unnecessary downtime, it must be possible for the system to recon\ufb01gure itself in order to continue observing, in a different mode if required, given the failure of a single non-critical subsystem.To increase software robustness, range checking and validity checking shall be supported before execution of any input command. This must be possible ahead of time, preparing observing sequences for automatic observations and simulating observations to estimate results. On-line pre-checking of the operational status of equipment should be done prior to sending critical or time consuming commands. It must be possible to apply continuous monitoring to all subsystems on request, both when in operation and when idle, to check their operational status. A measure of fault rates should be done during commissioning to establish baseline rates for system reliability monitoring. There are to be recovery procedures to restart after error failure. The system should be constantly monitoring active subsystems to be sure they are operating correctly before sending command to each subsystem. This monitoring should continue on inactive subsystems. The goal for recover and/or recon\ufb01guration is 5 minutes from onset of the error condition to observing again.

The software should be able to quickly bring the Gemini system to a safe state upon noti\ufb01cation of such danger. Subsystems must be able to detect such danger and report it appropriately. In the event that the risk persists, subsystems must be able to move themselves into safe states to protect people and equipment (i.e. if there is a failure in the higher-level systems). Safety protection must be applied whenever there is the risk that the actions of the control software could endanger people or cause damage to any Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystem, for example, by driving beyond limits or by overexposing detectors. This protection, where implemented, must be independent of the software. In general this will require mechanical hard stops, electrical interlocks, electrical hard limit switches, soft limit switches, software limits, and watch dogs,. The order in which these systems will work is as follows: software limits - the software will not allow unsafe actions; the command will be rejected; soft limit switches - the software will detect unsafe areas and halt; the software will allow movement off of soft limits; software watch dogs - the software will halt if its watch dog has not been reset; hardware watch dogs - the system will halt if its watch dog has not been reset; hard limit switches - these switches will remove power from actuator when beyond soft limits; the software/electrical systems will allow movement off of hard limits; hardware interlocks - these will prevent both software and hardware from action - there will be no bypass of these systems; hard stops - the mechanism cannot move beyond this point due to mechanical limit(s). In general hard stops will use dampers to avoid damage to equiment.",

Safety aspects shall be analyzed during the functional speci\ufb01cation phase of the software. Security must be provided in order to both prevent accidental mix-up of commands from different users on different parts of the system and to prevent intrusion from the wide area network into the Gemini 8m Telescopes. In particular, the astronomical database must be protected from intrusion, whether the purpose is to access private data or to be destructive. It is acceptable, and may well prove to be the best solution, to provide intrusion security by a well designed network gateway acting as a \ufb01rewall. A system that is operating in Engineering/Maintenance mode must ignore directives from other systems, though status information should still be provided for use by other systems. There should be security preventing the intrusion into the system by unauthorized users, or users at unauthorized access levels. All systems are appropriately interlocked. This interlock must not depend on any software for reliable operation. Details of the interlock system are found in the Mount Control System Work Package De\ufb01nition. The interlock philosophy is as follows: All hazards capable of causing death and/or loss of irreplacable equipment shall be passively interlocked; All hazards capable of causing injury and/or severe damage to equipment shall be actively interlocked (severe damage implies that repairs are not repairable at the depot level; All other hazards may be interlocked via software.",

The on-line databases can be considered part of this interface, but are only accessible through their de\ufb01ned interfaces. The software must be strictly modular, i.e. the functionality of a subsystem should correspond to that which belongs to that subsystem and only to that, so that software for different subsystems can be installed and maintained independently of all the rest.This is needed in particular for multi-instrument operation, for example, as instruments share the same subsystems on the telescope. At the same time, the possibility must exist to acquire information about other parts of the system (for example, telescope coordinates) (as mentioned in the control \ufb02ow requirements in Section 3.1.1). It also important that there are no undesired interactions between subsystems. This may be enforced either at the client/server interface or at the message system level.",

This means the video data signals must be encoded digitally and transferred via the WAN to remote sites.

(developed software); All additional data that is not required on line (con\ufb01guration information, detailed documentation, operation logs, etc.) are stored in a relational DBMS. (supported software).",
        "Input data are all data that are prede\ufb01ned at operation start. This includes catalogs, calibrations and \ufb02at \ufb01elds available in archives, etc. Observing commands (whether entered interactively or via the Sequencer) are input data that provide information on the course of operation and trigger events.",
        "Replies to commands, including status information, updates to parameters, video and astronomical information are considered data outputs. These data end up in the different databases. Operational information, such as logging messages, alarms, and errors are special forms of output data, since they are made available for later inspection and debugging.",
        "One criteria is that suf\ufb01cient information be recorded during an observation to recreate the sequence of events that occurred during the observation. This requires that all input and output data be logged appropriately. Given an initial set of con\ufb01guration parameters, the Gemini system operates via a sequence of commands. This operation is complemented by using previously stored data, calibrations, and star catalogs",
        "Automatic operation. This is the normal mode of operation. The observation is performed through a preplanned program requiring little or no interaction with the observer; Interactive operation. Science planning and program changes are accomplished through interactive operation. Is is possible to enter interactive operation from automatic operation to handle exceptional conditions.This is the normal mode of operation at maintenance and test levels; Modes and control. Normal operation is possible at all operation levels (observing, maintenance, and test) and applies to the following conditions (where appropriate) on any subsystem:; Observing; Stand-by; Maintenance and testing. Performance. Overall performance of the Gemini telescope is de\ufb01ned as the percentage of viewable time during which exposures have been taken (i.e. sum of all exposure times over available time for exposures). To improve this performance, all possible concurrencies in system operation should be used. Best use of concurrency occurs when using the Sequencer; Start-up and shut-down. There are start-up and shut-down procedures that must exist at many different levels:; Cold start-up, starting the system from scratch (including time to download all software) should take about 5 minutes. This does not include time to start-up the telescope or instruments; Warm start-up, starting from scratch but also excluding software download time should take about 1 minute; Telescope start-up, measured from end of cold or warm start-up should be about 4 minutes; Instrument start-up, measured from end of telescope start-up, should take 2 minutes or less.There must be a way to shut down all subsystems (hardware and software). All start-ups and shut-downs are to be automatically logged with time stamps, to allow for statistics on system availability. Logging; System logging information should include all important events, properly timestamped and indexed. The goal is to be able to recreate the steps in a observation from the system logs. Engineering Logging; It must be possible to log engineering data at up to 200 Hz rates for short periods of time. This data must be available to external software packages for analysis; Long-term logging of engineering data must be possible at slower (1 Hz or less) rates, into a common format (baselined as SYBASE).",
        "Fault-tolerance and recovery See Attributes, Section 4.1 on page 4 - 1; Error logging. There are three types of errors:; Fatal Fatal errors occur if there is no acceptable recovery procedure that will allow operation to proceed. Under fatal error conditions, the system falls back to a safe \"backup\" state requiring human intervention for restart; Serious Under serious errors, the system does not need to move off-line, but the current operation cannot be completed. Serious errors require human intervention to restart full operation; Warning All other unexpected conditions result in warnings that are properly logged. The system continues operation, though perhaps with reduced ef\ufb01ciency. All subsystems must group errors into these categories. In addition, errors that result in an \"alarm\" should be described, along with the proper action required to acknowledge and eliminate the alarm condition. Besides the time-stamp, error logging should provide enough information to trace the condition back to its apparent source, both in equipment and in event sequence. There should be tools available to extract error (and other) logging information by subsystem component, time- sequence, previous events, and so on. The Gemini Control System formally distinguishes alarms from errors. Errors result from failures to successfully complete commands, while alarms represent asynchronous failures. Note that an error may result in an alarm.There are two types of alarm conditions. The \ufb01rst are automatically monitored alarms, which exist as long as the errors persist and are then automatically cleared. The second type of alarm require human acknowledgment to clear. Recovery In addition to start-up procedures, there must be well-de\ufb01ned recovery procedures for any subsystem that has become inoperative. Command retries must be included in the system for most common timeouts or noresponse conditions. These retries should occur automatically in the command handling to avoid unnecessary error conditions; Performance The performance of error-mode recovery is speci\ufb01c to the subsystem and is de\ufb01ned in the Functional speci\ufb01cation for that subsystem; Normally, there is no recovery possible from a fatal error except to shut-down and then restart the subsystem. However, in the case of an instrument failure, it may be possible to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations that do not require that particular instrument; For serious errors, it may be possible to continue operation with degraded performance. For example, failure of automatic tracking may require manual tracking; other errors may result in operation with a different instrument; Under normal conditions, the number of warnings should be small. The system should monitor the rate of warning messages since an increase might indicate that some tuning or maintenance is appropriate. Ideally, such conditions should be noted by the subsystems before reaching the OCS level; Failure conditions should not cascade. That is, failure of one subsystem should not affect other, working, subsystems, including communication links.",

The choice for a development environment is based on the following criteria:; Productivity and development tools; Software portability and hardware independence; Vendor independence; Industry and de-facto standards; Support for state-of-the-art user interfaces; Support of a distributed environment. Given these criteria, the following recommendations exist. The development operating system is UNIX System V, Release 4, using only POSIX compliant calls to the operating system. In particular, vendor speci\ufb01c extensions are not permitted. Compliance to POSIX is measured against the book: POSIX Programmer\u2019s Guide - Writing Portable UNIX Programs, by Donald Lewine, O\u2019Reilly & Associates, Inc. 1991; Any special needs that cannot be acceptably met by the available operating system calls are to be discussed with the GPO on a case-by-case basis; Some packages (such as GUI interfaces and database interfaces) have higher portability requirements that may require the speci\ufb01cation of higher level interfaces to the OS; The GUI systems are to use X-windows, version 11, release 5 (X11R5) or release 6 (X11R6). The principle language for developing GUIs is Tcl/Tk; The GNU software tool suite should be used where possible; Imake is recommended, with GNU\u2019s autocon\ufb01gure utility an acceptable alternative; CVS is the recommended version control system. IOC and cross-development system software. A number of real-time operating systems were examined for compatibility with the goals for the Gemini Project. At the same time, the availability of cross-support development environments was considered. The recommendations are:; The IOCs will use the real-time operating system VxWorks (from Wind River Systems); The communication interface between the IOCs and Unix workstations is to be IMP; It is assumed that all IOC software is to be developed on Unix workstations in a windowed development environment; The cross-compiler to be used for IOC software development is one speci\ufb01ed by the Gemini Project. It is the GNU cc compiler as furnished with VxWorks; IOC software development is to be done using a common development environment, as speci\ufb01ed in the Software Programming Standards (SPS). Software below the IOC level. There is likely to be software below the IOC level, but it should not require downloading, except possibly for upgrades, typically being placed into ROM or FLASH memory. Any access to this embedded software while it is connected to the system is strictly through software in the IOC. From outside the IOC this software appears as part of the electronics. Although this software is not considered part of the Gemini software, it is obviously an advantage (for maintenance purposes) to have it conform to the requirements of Gemini software; Installation system software The host workstation operating system is Unix, currently baselined as Solaris 2.3 or above.

Some \ufb01elds are common to all record types and others are speci\ufb01c to particular record types. Every record has a record name and every \ufb01eld has a \ufb01eld name. The \ufb01rst \ufb01eld of every database record holds the record name, which must be unique across all IOCs attached to the same TCP/IP subnet. A number of data structures are provided so that the database can be accessed ef\ufb01ciently. Most software components, because they access the database via database access routines, do not need to be aware of these structures; Databases Access With the exception of record and device support, all access to the database is via the channel or database access routines; Databases Scanning Database scanning is the mechanism for deciding when to process a record. Four types of scanning are possible: Periodic, Event, I/O Event, and Passive. Periodic: A request can be made to process a record periodically. A number of time intervals are supported. Event: Event scanning is based on the posting of an event by any IOC software component. The actual subroutine call is: post_event(event_num) I/O Event: The I/O event scanning system processes records based on external interrupts. An IOC device driver interrupt routine must be available to accept the external interrupts. Passive: Passive records are processed as a result of linked records being processed or as a result of external changes such as channel access puts; Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers In order to remove record speci\ufb01c knowledge from database access, each record type has an associated record support module. Similarly, in order to remove device speci\ufb01c knowledge from record support, each record type can have a set of device support modules. If the method of accessing hardware is complicated, a device driver can be provided to shield the device support modules. Many record types, in particular all types not associated with hardware, do not have device support or drivers. The IOC software is designed so that the database access layer knows nothing about the record support layer other than how to call it. The record support layer in turn knows nothing about it\u2019s device support layer other than how to call it. Similarly the only thing a device support layer knows about it\u2019s associated driver is how to call it. This design allows a particular installation and even a particular IOC within an installation to choose the set of record types, device types, and drivers it wishes to use. The remainder of the IOC system software is unaffected. Every record support module must provide a record processing routine. It is this routine that is called by the database scanners. Record processing consists of some combination of a standard set of functions; Databases Monitors The routines described in this section provide a callback mechanism for database value changes. This allows the caller to be noti\ufb01ed when database values change without constantly polling the database. A mask can be set to specify value changes, alarm state changes, and/or archive changes. At the present time only channel access uses database monitors. No other software should use the database monitors. Because they are of interest only to channel access, the monitor routines will not be described.",
        "Channel access provides network transparent access to IOC databases. It is based on a client-server model. Each IOC provides a channel access server which is willing to establish communication with an arbitrary number of clients. Channel access client services are available on both OPIs and IOCs. A client can communicate with an arbitrary number of servers. It should be noted that channel access does not provide access to database records as records. This is a deliberate design decision. This allows new record types to be addedwithout impacting any software that accesses the database via channel access. A channel access client can communicate with multiple IOCs having differing sets of record types.",
        "EPICS provides a number of OPI based tools. These can be divided into two groups based on whether or not they use channel access. Channel access tools are real time tools, i.e. they are used to monitor and control IOCs. Channel Access Tools; MEMD Motif version of combined display manager and display editor; DM Display Manager This tool reads one or more display list \ufb01les created by EDD, establishes communication with all necessary IOCs, establishes monitors on process variables, accepts operator control requests, and updates the display to re\ufb02ect all changes; ALH Alarm Handler This is a general purpose alarm handler driven by an alarm con\ufb01guration \ufb01le; AR Archive This is a general purpose tool to acquire and save data from IOCs; Sequencer A tool which runs in an IOC or OPI and emulates a \ufb01nite state machine; Other OPI CA clients It is possible to interface preexisting software systems to the channel access library. This has been done for several commercial packages including IDL/ PvWave, Mathematica, and WINGZ to allow access and manipulation of EPICS process variables by these applications. Othe OPI Tools; DCT Databases Configuration Tool This tool is used to create a run time database for an IOC; CAPFAST and GDCT Graphical Databases Configuration Tools These tools are used to create a run time database for an IOC; EDD Display Editor This tool is used to create a display list \ufb01le for the Display Manager. A display list \ufb01le contains a list of static, monitor, and control elements. Each monitor and control element has an associated process variable; SNC State Notation Compiler It generates a C program that represents the states for the IOC or OPI Sequencer tool; Build Tools Tools are available to create the various database components from ASCII de\ufb01nition \ufb01les; Source/Release EPICS provides a Source/Release mechanism for managing EPICS.",
        "EPICS consists of a set of core software and a set of optional components. The core software, i.e. the components of EPICS without which EPICS would not function, are: Channel Access - Client and Server software; Database; Scanners; Monitors; DCT; Build Tools; Source/Release.",
        "All other software components are optional. Of course any application developer would be crazy to ignore tools such as MEDM (or EDD/DM). Likewise an application developer would not start from scratch developing record and device support. Most OPI tools do not, however, have to be used. Likewise any given record support module, device support module, or driver could be deleted from a particular IOC and EPICS will still function.",
        "Each of the Gemini Controls work packages will be involved with some aspect of EPICS development ranging from creation of new device drivers to database creation and the design of new CA clients.The details of the EPICS work required can be broken down into several broad categories which re\ufb02ect the nature of the various work packages. This breakdown is given in the following subsections:",
        "Channel Access - Client and Server Software, Scanners, Monitors Gemini will not modify the heart of EPICS. We leave this to Los Alamos; Host-based Development Tools (CAPFAST, EDD, etc.) Neither will Gemini plan on creating new development tools.",
        "Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers For Gemini this entails support for new devices: PMAC, VMIC5578, BANCOMM.",
        "Other OPI CA Clients The OCS may need a CA client that implements the OCS Attribute/Value protocol. The DHS may need a CA client that gathers logging information. This could be an EPICS AR (or AR_cmd) task.",
        "IOC Database; IOC SNC programs; Files associated with OPI Channel Access Tools These would include MEDM .adl display de\ufb01nition \ufb01les, PvWave/IDL scripts, AR request \ufb01les, ALH alarm con\ufb01guration \ufb01les, and the like.",
        "For the purposes of work performed for the Gemini 8-m Telescopes Project the following de\ufb01nitions will be used to differentiate between the two \ufb02avors of EPICS development work: Internals work would include any of the following:; Channel Access - Client and Server Software, Scanners, Monitors; Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers; Host-based Development Tools (CAPFAST, EDD, etc.); Other OPI CA Clients. The \ufb01rst two items would be suitable topics for an advanced EPICS course on EPICS System Development. The latter two items would be covered under Advanced Application Development and a case can probably be made that they constitute a category unto themselves which should be labeled something like \u2018Internals - Tools\u2019; Applications work would then include any of:; IOC Database; IOC or OPI SNC programs; Files associated with OPI Channel Access Tools.",
        "These are all topics that would be covered in an EPICS Basics, Building and Using Applications course.",
        "For each class of developer a speci\ufb01c set of skills is required. The following sections list those that would be commonly used.",
        "Knowledge of VME and other I/O electronics; EPICS Database design techniques; SNC programming; Use of standard EPICS OPI tools; Basic knowledge of UNIX and VxWorks as development environments.",
        "Advanced C/C++ programming techniques; UNIX internals; VxWorks internals; Real-time programming techniques; Motif application development skills; Networking skills: TCP/P and UDP/IP sockets.",
        "The experience of the High Energy Physics community is that only a core group of Internals developers is required for maintenance and enhancement of EPICS IOC software and of the standard development and CA client tool set. Speci\ufb01cally, the IOC core software is almost exclusively in the domain of the Los Alamos AOT-8 of\ufb01ce. Two major \ufb02avors of development tools are in use with support coming from key groups within Los Alamos and Argonne. Many sites contribute custom CA client tools as this generally involves C or C++ programming under a UNIX O/S to interface to the standard CA library. In addition, many sites create their own database record types and new device support and driver layers. Although there is presently a large amount of activity in the enhancement of EPICS Internals software especially in the \ufb01elds of non-IOC core software, this is an order of magnitude less than the amount of Applications work under way at over 20 distinct programs.",
        "Another large group of predominately Applications developers that are starting work are the Collaborative Access Teams (CATS) at Argonne\u2019s Advanced Photon Source (APS).The APS is a facility to produce high brilliance X-rays for a variety of experiments and includes 36 experimental halls with 2 lines each. As of March 1994, there were 15 CATS at the APS with most CATS responsible for a single sector (2 beamlines). Each CAT has its own funding for designing/building/operating the physical beamline, instrumentation, controls, and data acquisition systems. Because the experimental areas must be coordinated with the main facility control system and since 25% of the beamtime must be made available to independent investigators it was strongly recommended that EPICS be used as the toolkit for all CATS development work. Not only would this simplify the integration with the central control system but would also provide a common environment for facility visitors. Typically, each CAT has 1 or 2 developers, and the major focus is not on the IOC software although some new records, like the Multichannel Analyser, have been created, but rather on the OPI CA client applications. Heavy use is being made of both Tcl/TK and IDL to support high-level sequencing and data reduction. This is similar to the Gemini architecture as the bulk of the control system intelligence is contained within OPI CA client tasks. Other items of concern are: Different science programs in use at each CAT which have complex associated data acquisition and reduction routines; The creation of large data sets; Simultaneous local and remote monitoring and intervention; Ease of use for one-time users; Data export to home institutions.",
        "The Standard Instrument Controller work package is tasked with laying the Internals ground work for all other Gemini control system work packages. In this project, the only required IOC-based Internals work is the creation of record, device, and driver support for three VME I/O cards. It is anticipated that all other IOC-related work packages will be performing exclusively Applications work. In the advent of future work packages requiring Internals work it is planned the RGO SIC development staff will be made available. In this way the number of Internals staff is kept at a minimum.",
        "There are several means of transmitting commands and data across the Gemini system: Direct A command source may directly specify the target subsystem. This is the most common means of command transfer from the Observatory Control System to the subsystems; Channel Commands and data may be routed through a channel. This mechanism requires that some (unknown to the source) target subsystem has been attached to the channel as the target. It is possible that the channel is 'intelligent', in the sense that data may be converted from one form to another during transmission. This might be implemented by connecting two channels with a conversion module. An example of a channel connection might be the data stream between the A&G system and the Primary Mirror Control System. The A&G might be transmitting Zernickes to the PMCS, which is receiving Shack- Hartmann data. The intelligent channel would be responsible for the conversion. It is possible that a channel have multiple sources, multiple targets, or both! Finally, a channel might use a separate physical route, to prevent large data transmissions (say) from interfering with the 'normal' command streams; Broadcast Some commands and data signals are simply broadcast across the control system. Any subsystem may examine these communications and respond or ignore as appropriate. For example, the OCS might broadcast a RunTest command, causing all subsystems to perform self-testing. As another example, a critical system failure might cause a ShutDown command to be broadcast.",
        "All commands contain the same general structure: Identi\ufb01cation:; Command_ID; Source; Target. The Command_ID is an identi\ufb01cation that is unique to that speci\ufb01c instance of each command. A portion of the ID is monotonically increasing and functions as a timestamp for journalling and tracing. This is to be implemented using a technique analogous to the CFHT odometer. The Source and Target \ufb01elds indicate the originator and the recipient for the command, as expected. The Target may be a speci\ufb01c recipient, a Channel, or simply a Broadcast, but the Source is always the origination point of the command. Istruction:; Opcode; Parameter set. The remainder of the command provides the body of the command. The Parameter list structure is dependent on the Opcode.",
        "This section presents the \u201cgeneric\u201d commands that all Gemini systems must respond to. There are also \u201cControl Commands\u201d common to all Gemini systems to provide speci\ufb01c functionality during observing. These control commands are presented in the Gemini Software Design Description. Speci\ufb01c commands are presented in the Software Design Descriptions for the individual subsystems.",
        "The following commands are \u201cstatus\u201d queries used to obtain information about the state of the subsystem. Getversion The subsystem returns its version identi\ufb01cation as a string value; Getstatus. The subsystem reports its current status as one of:; DOWN the subsystem is not operational; BOOTED the subsystem has been booted, but not yet con\ufb01gured; CONFIGURING the system is in the process of con\ufb01guring (Steven); CONFIGURED the subsystem is con\ufb01gured, but not yet initialized; INITIALIZING the subsystem is doing initialization actions; RUNNING the subsystem is running at observing level; MAINTENANCE the subsystem is running at maintenance level; SIMULATION the subsystem is running in simulation mode; DISABLE the subsystem is functional, but has been commanded to ignore control commands; SHUTDOWN the subsystem is in the process of shutting down; LOCKED an interlock exists on this subsystem.

        "The following commands affect the behavior of a subsystem independently of the speci\ufb01c task of that subsystem. SetStatus The target subsystem is to enter the state associated with the speci\ufb01ed status argument. For example, SetStatus SIMULATION causes the targeted subsystem(s) to enter simulation mode. Setting the status to SHUTDOWN disables a subsystem. Not all status levels are reachable through SetStatus; SetConfigurations This command directs the downloading of a con\ufb01guration from the host to the target subsystem. It is important that care be taken to avoid con\ufb01guration values that would result in motion, etc. This command can operate with the GetCon\ufb01guration command given above to provide 'sequencing points' for subsystem restarts or roll backs; RunTest. The subsystem runs a self-test and reports the result as one of:; OK the subsystem has detected no problems, it is running within speci\ufb01cations; BAD the subsystem has detected problems that prevent its successful operation; WARNING. the subsystem has detected a problem that may prevent it from operating to full speci\ufb01cation, but does not prevent it from functioning at this time. There may be an argument describing a particular self-test to run. The individual selftests are speci\ufb01c to the subsystem and are given in the appropriate Work Package Description.

        "Communication of information is similar across all systems in the Gemini controls network. Instances of this communication is via routes, which may be direct channels, intelligent channels, or broadcasts. Communication via a route is typically asynchronous, with commands available to establish synchronization as needed. OpenRoute A route of the indicated class is being established for some item. The command includes suf\ufb01cient information on the route to permit the IOC to communicate through the route. The 'route' may be a speci\ufb01c subsystem, channel, or broadcast; CloseRoute The route is to be reinitialized. Modules receiving this command are to \ufb02ush buffers associated with this route and reset operating parameters to initial conditions; TestRoute A test message is transmitted across the route. All receivers on the route are to respond with an identi\ufb01cation; AwaitItem The module sending this command is blocked until information is received via the indicated route, or a timeout occurs; SetCallback A callback is established to process data across the indicated route; ClearCallback A previously established callback is removed.",

        "The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories: (I) Mandatory (indicated by \u2018(M)\u2019 at the end of the paragraph). It is mandatory that each railway meets these specifications where interoperability on lines, or equipment interoperability, is required; Optional (indicated by \u2018(O)\u2019 at the end of the paragraph). Whilst not being mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory, both to provide a consistent service and to present a recognised and agreed standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development and manufacture; Information (indicated by \u2018(I)\u2019 at the end of the paragraph). These are statements intended to provide explanatory notes.",
        "The system is based on the ETSI GSM standard. To meet additional functionality and performance requirements, this standard is to be supplemented by: (I) the following GSM services:; voice broadcast service; voice group call service; enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption; General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); railway specific applications:; exchange of number and location information between train and ground to support functional and location dependent addressing; emergency calls; shunting mode; multiple driver communications; direct mode facility for set-to-set operation; railway specific features, network parameters and standards:; link assurance signal; calling and connected line presentation of functional identities; cab radio, man-machine and other interfaces; environmental specifications; controller position functional specifications; system configuration (numbering plans, priority levels, subscriber details, closed user groups, etc).",

        "The system is based on the GSM architecture which is summarised in figure 1-3. (I)",
        "The system comprises the following elements: (I) Base station sub-systems (BSSs) of base station controllers (BSCs) controlling base transceiver stations (BTSs) each containing a number of transceivers (TRXs); Network sub-systems (NSSs) interfacing to the BSS via the GSM \u2018A\u2019 interface. The NSS contains mobile services switching centres (MSCs) with primary responsibility for call control. The MSC is supported by a visitor location register (VLR) containing temporary details of subscribers active within the MSC area, a group call register (GCR) containing attributes of voice group and broadcast call configurations for the related MSC area and home location registers (HLRs) holding subscriber details on a permanent basis; The network also comprises General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) infrastructure elements supporting the respective packet radio services. The serving GPRS support node (SGSN) is a location register function storing subscription information and location information for each subscriber registered in that node. It interfaces to the BSS via the Gb interface and to the MSC/VLR via the Gs interface and to the HLR via the Gr interface. The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a location register function storing subscription information and routeing information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS MS to the SGSN where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the GGSN has at least one PDP context active. It interfaces to the SGSN via the Gn interface, to the HLR via the Gx interface, to external packet data networks via the Gi interface and to other GSM/GPRS networks via the Gp interface; Mobile equipment (ME) interfacing to the BSS via the air (Um) interface; Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) containing information specific to single subscribers. A standardised interface links mobile equipment to SIM cards. A SIM and ME combined are termed a mobile station (MS); Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC) for managing the network; Billing Centre.",
        "Signalling within the NSS and between NSSs is carried out according to signalling system number 7, SS7, making specific use of the mobile application part (MAP) of that standard. (I)",
        "Railway networks may implement a short message service centre to be interfaced to the GSM network in order to support railway specific messaging applications. (I)",
        "A railway GSM network is also likely to have external interfaces to: (I) private railway fixed networks; public operator networks; controller equipment; specialised railway systems (eg train control systems).",
        "EIRENE will provide the radio bearer for ERTMS/ETCS. The EURORADIO layers are responsible for ensuring the overall safety of the transmission link between train-borne and trackside ERTMS/ETCS applications. (I)",
        "In addition to a GSM capability, a direct mode capability may be provided for railway mobiles for set-to-set operation. (I)",
        "Standardised interface protocols are to be provided to allow applications external to EIRENE to access EIRENE bearer services. (I)",
        "Applications may include: (I) public address; intercom; driver safety device; train borne recorder.",
        "To meet the specific railway requirements, a number of additional features are required some of which have been incorporated in the GSM Standard. The main aspects are summarised in the following paragraphs. (I)",
        "Equipment is to be capable of operation in the following frequency bands: (I) Band Railway GSM (R-GSM); Frequencies (MHz) 876-915/921-960.",
        "Note: the R-GSM band includes the Public GSM (P-GSM) and Extended GSM (E-GSM) bands.",
        "All mobiles are to support these services as defined in the relevant GSM specifications. The services will mainly be used to: (I) broadcast messages from controllers to certain groups of trains in a controller area; broadcast messages from trains or shunting team members to controllers or other mobiles in a defined area; conduct group calls between train drivers and controllers over pre-defined areas; conduct group calls between trackside workers, shunting team members, station staff and similar groups, typically over local areas.",
        "This GSM specification is to be implemented in order to achieve the high performance requirements necessary for emergency group calls. It is also necessary to meet different grades of service requirements for different types of communications traffic on the system (eg safety (eg train control system), operational and administrative communications). (I)",
        "Many railway staff need to be addressed by functional rather than personal numbers. The functional numbers may change on a regular basis. The principal example is that of train drivers, who need to be addressed by train numbers which change with each journey. To overcome this difficulty a translation facility will be provided to allow calls to functional numbers to be forwarded to the most appropriate personal number at that time. Thus calls made to a train number are forwarded by the network to the appropriate driver or locomotive for that train at that time. (I)",
        "A follow-me service will be implemented in the EIRENE network using the GSM Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) facility to allow users to establish and terminate the forwarding of calls from a functional number to their personal number. (I)",
        "Train drivers need to be able to contact controllers and other staff at the push of a single button. As the train moves through different areas, controllers are liable to change. As a consequence it is necessary to provide a means of addressing calls from a train to certain functions based on the location of the train. (I)",
        "The only source of location information available within the GSM network is the cell that the train is in. However, there are a number of external sources from which more accurate location information may be derived: (I) on-train location systems; trackside balises; information from ground based systems.",
        "Within EIRENE, the primary means of determining the location of a train for the purpose of location dependent addressing will be based on the cell dependent routing. This may be supplemented with additional information from external systems to provide a greater degree of accuracy. (I)",
        "Railway mobiles may support a direct communications mode whereby a mobile can communicate with all other railway mobiles in a local area without the use of GSM infrastructure. Such a mode is required for use where: (I) no GSM infrastructure is provided; GSM infrastructure equipment has failed.",

Sections 5, 6, and 7 detail the additional requirements for Cab radio, General purpose radio, and Operational radio equipment respectively. Note that for the handheld version of the General purpose radio, commercial standards apply. (I)",
        "Section 8 covers controller equipment. Section 9 is concerned with a numbering plan for the variety of functional numbers which are required. Section 10 details the handling of other information, such as priority, closed user groups and encryption algorithms, which must be applied consistently in all networks. (I)",

        "The railway specific services to be supported are listed in table 2-4. Functional addressing (section 11) M; Location dependent addressing (section 11) M; Shunting mode (section 14) M; Multiple driver communications (section 5) M; Emergency calls (section 13) M.",
        "The call waiting service (CW) permits a party A to be notified of an incoming call from party C whilst the traffic channel is not available for the incoming call and party A is engaged in an active call with party B. However call waiting does not operate during the prior set up of the call between the parties A and B (including alerting if used). Therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the risk for the party A of missing notification of an incoming call from party C with a higher eMLPP priority. Taking into account technical and operational aspects, it is recommended to set the relevant timer(s) in the network in such a way that the maximum alerting duration is limited to 60s. (I)",
        "EIRENE mobiles are specified to conform to a common minimum standard of performance. It is the responsibility of national railways to design their EIRENE networks to provide the required level of service to EIRENE compliant mobiles. (I)",
        "This section draws together specifications and information related to the planning of an EIRENE network and provides guidance on target performance levels. Additional information on communication requirements for the ERTMS/ETCS application is provided in [ERTMS COMMS]. (I)",
        "For network planning, the coverage level is defined as the field strength at the antenna on the roof of a train (nominally a height of 4m above the track). An isotropic antenna with a gain of 0dBi is assumed. This criterion will be met with a certain probability in the coverage area. (The target coverage power level is dependent on the statistical fluctuations caused by the actual propagation conditions.) (I)",
        "The following minimum values shall apply: (M) coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 38.5 dBmV/m (-98 dBm) for voice and non-safety critical data; coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 41.5 dBmV/m (-95 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds lower than or equal to 220km/h.",

        "The EIRENE mobile installation shall be designed to operate in a network meeting the criteria in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. (M) Note 1: The specified coverage probability means that with a probability value of at least 95% in each location interval (length: 100m) the measured coverage level shall be greater than or equal to the figures stated above. The coverage levels specified above consider a maximum loss of 3 dB between antenna and receiver and an additional margin of 3 dB for other factors such as ageing. (I); The values for ETCS levels 2/3 concerning coverage and speed-limitations are to be validated and, if necessary, reviewed after the first operational implementation of ETCS. (I).",
        "The handover success rate should be at least 99.5% over train routes under design load conditions (as given in [EN 301 515, Index [30]]). (O)",
        "To avoid the necessity for large cell overlaps to accommodate high speed train operations, optimisation of the handover process for such trains is considered necessary. Suitable algorithms will be tested and refined as necessary during the trials process. (I)",
        "The proposed events for measurement of the start and stop of the handover execution at the mobile are: (I) receipt of \u2018handover command\u2019; receipt of \u2018UA\u2019 after \u2018physical info\u2019 on new channel.",
        "There is a quality of service requirement for handover executions (eg a break of 10s would clearly be unacceptable to the user). 300ms represents our current best estimate of the QoS figure, although this will need to be confirmed through user trials. (I)",
        "An additional option is available to reduce the handover break period, namely the use of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms. Synchronous handover requires the BTS transmissions in different cells to be synchronised by the system. Each authority can decide whether it wishes to use synchronised BTSs. (I)",

        "This document describes the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) functional requirements for systems implemented to participate in the management of outbreaks and other health events. Outbreak Management (OM) is the PHIN functional area intended to support the needs of investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of a health event or act of bioterrorism. OM should aid in the collection and analysis of data to support identifying and containing the health event. OM systems should be configurable to meet the needs of different types of health events, and capture data related to cases, contacts, investigations, exposures, relationships, clinical and environmental specimens/samples, laboratory results, vaccinations and treatments, travel history, and conveyance information. The application should also allow for new objects to be defined and created during the course of an investigation. Central to the functionality of a system supporting OM is the ability to collect data related to cases and exposures and to create traceable links between all appropriate entities. By tracing the mechanism of transmission and identifying the source of the health event, the appropriate response staff can more effectively contain the event. Systems supporting OM should also be integrated with the systems supporting early event detection, countermeasure administration, laboratory, and surveillance to achieve the primary goal of managing the response to and mitigating the effects of an event. This document provides minimum operational requirements necessary to support an outbreak management system and should in no way preclude a system from incorporating additional functionality beyond what has been covered in this document.",

Where they exist, systems supporting OM should use them. As additional standards are defined, they should be accepted and implemented; 2.7 Operations: Personnel, roles, activities, and responsibilities necessary to support all aspects of OM should be clearly defined; 2.8 System Security and Availability: Security of OM data includes the protection of data from corruption and access by unauthorized individuals, as well as the protection of the actual systems supporting OM from sabotage or other failure.

Thus as a change of paradigm, the OBA concept finances agreed outputs with predefined quality rather than pre-defined inputs by selling vouchers for STD services at subsidised prices to patients. These vouchers will be refunded to service providers in the private sector (medical doctors, qualified nurses and midwives), government hospitals, NGOs, and faith-based organisations. The major advantages of the OBA approach are, that it allows To target resources to address selected health problems,; To target the provision of services to specific parts of the population and; To stimulate private market initiative and competition.",

Thus, this document provides a basis for evaluating the proposal for internetworking between CDNs. This is the version 0.1 of the software requirements specification.",
        "When writing this SRS for CDN peering, the following terminologies are used: Web server (WS): The container of content comprising of two layers\uf8e7overlay, which is a collection of Web service host (e.g. Apache, Tomcat), Service Level Agreement (SLA)- allocator, and policy agent, and core, which refers to the underlying hardware infrastructure; Mediator: A policy-driven entity, authoritative for policy negotiation and management; Service registry (SR): Discovers and stores resource and policy information in local domain; Peering Agent (PA): A resource discovery module in the peering CDNs environment; Policy repository (PR): A storage of Web server, mediator and peering policies; PWS: A set of Web server-specific rules for content storage and management; PM: A set of mediator-specific rules for interaction and negotiation; PPeering: A set of rules for creation and growth of the peering arrangement.",

        "The final product enabling CDN peering assists in coordinated and cooperative content delivery via internetworking among distinct CDNs to allow providers to rapidly \u201cscale-out\u201d to meet both flash crowds and anticipated increases in demand, and remove the need for a single CDN to provision resources. An ad-hoc or planned peering of CDNs requires fundamental research to be undertaken to address the core problems of measuring and disseminating load information, performing request assignment and redirection, enabling content replication and determining appropriate compensation among participants on a geographically distributed \u201cInternet\u201d scale. In contrast to a single CDN, for which these issues are deeply interrelated and co-dependent, the main thrust for the final product enabling CDN peering is to consider them in a coordinated and cooperative manner among many peered CDNs, whilst satisfying the complex multi-dimensional constraints placed on each individual provider. Each provider must ensure that their individual SLAs are met when serving content for its own customers to end users, while meeting any obligations it has made when participating in a group of many providers.",
        "This document builds on the following references: An introduction to CDN technologies [1]; The research problem for internetworking of CDNs [2]; The architecture for CDN peering [3]; The performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance [4]; CDN peering models along with the challenges for implementation [5].",
        "CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise. It is formed by a set of autonomous CDNs, which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers. It is expected that an effective peering arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur. Initiation: A CDN\u2019s reach and scale is limited by its ability to handle peak load, cost of equipment, scalable infrastructure, and/or demand for the increased coverage of its infrastructure. Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing with other CDN(s). It is triggered by an initialization request sent to the mediator under exceptional circumstances, e.g. flash crowds, when the (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the workload on its Web Servers (WSs). The triggering condition must consider the expected and unexpected load increases in the initiating CDN; Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect with other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship. In the business domain, this relationship (most likely) would take the form of a legal document which describes the expected level of services from the involving parties such as storage requirements, the required rate of transfer, cost of services; the expected duration of receiving service, penalties for service violations, and other preconditions such as the initiating CDN\u2019s preference to gain resources at a particular region. Negotiated relationships can also be established through means nontechnical terms (financial statement) or technical terms (SLAs). Thus, negotiated relationships must specify the interactions among entities including service administration, coordination and disband (or re-arrangement) of internetworked CDNs. In the CDN peering architecture, the mediator instance obtains the resource and access information from the Service Registry (SR), whilst SLAs and other policies from the Policy Repository (PR). The mediator instance on the primary CDN\u2019s behalf generates its service requirements based on the current circumstance and SLA requirements of its customer(s). Therefore, divergent policies are allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy; Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with. The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers. The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs. If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point. Otherwise, it carries out short term negotiations with the Peering Agent (PA) identified peering targets; CDN peering protocols: The next step is to configure the \u2018CDN peering\u2019 protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships. This step includes advertising the configurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.) of enlisted CDNs through inter-PA communication. On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer. Request-redirection in a peering arrangement depends on the content distribution and request-routing policies (specified in the CDN peering protocols) associated with the content as well as the specific algorithms and methods used for directing these requests; Operational management: When the primary CDN acquires sufficient resources from the peers to meet its SLA with the customer, the new peering arrangement becomes operational. Hence, necessary functional policies are deployed and administered in an effective way. Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s). Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships. If no CDN is interested in such peering, peering arrangement creation through re-negotiation is resumed by tuning the negotiated relationships with reconsidered service requirements; Disband or re-arrangement: An existing peering arrangement may need to either disband or re-arrange itself (within the scope of the negotiated relationships) if any of the following conditions hold: (a) the circumstances under which the arrangement was formed no longer hold; (b) peering is no longer beneficial for the participating CDNs; (c) an existing peering arrangement needs to be expanded further in order to deal with additional load; or (d) participating CDNs are not meeting their agreed upon contributions. Figure 1 presents the interaction flows within the architecture of the CDN peering with an abstraction on its components.",
        "The software infrastructure enabling peering between CDNs can be featured with the following major goals: Development and validation of peering and manage the complexity of content delivery across Web servers of multiple CDNs that scale across the globe; Decrease cost of Web access, increase QoS through reduced latency, reduce server load, and bandwidth consumption (by a particular CDN server), thus improving the performance of content delivery; Assists an existing CDN to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short-term load spikes (i.e. flash crowds) effectively. The operations performed by the product components [3] assist to realize the above goals. Component-wise major functions are noted below. The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents are as follows, A Web server replicates content on-demand from the origin server and stores it for future use; In the event of Web hotspot, it initiates request to trigger peering; The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with other CDNs; The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted; The SLA-allocator performs the provisioning and reservation of Web server\u2019s resources (e.g. CPU, bandwidth, storage etc.) to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced; The Web servers\u2019 underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers. The Mediator performs the following major functions, It generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships; It passes the service requirements to the PA; It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs; Once a peering arrangement is established, it controls what portion of the Web traffic (i.e. end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used; It ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience). The main functions of the Service Registry are as follows, It encapsulates the resource and service information for each CDN; It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details; In the face of traffic surges, it supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator; When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources. The Policy Repository is used to perform the following functions, It virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including PWS, PM, and PPeering (i.e. Web server-specific policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peering arrangement; It provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement; It returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements. A Peering Agent carries out the following major functions, It acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations; It exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs; It is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them. The operations performed by the components of the CDN peering is driven by semi-autonomous logic that ensures content is served reliably through content replication, request-routing and redirection whilst maintaining constant awareness of the health (e.g. load information) of participants. These major architectural features of the CDN peering are briefly described in the following: Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data. Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute; Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.e. mediator, PA and policy repository as a single conceptual entity) in a periodic or thresholdbased manner. The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers; Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels \u2013 at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster. Therefore, endusers can be assigned via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate.",
        "The users of the software infrastructure enabling CDN peering can be differentiated by using their membership and contributions to the system. A given peering arrangement consists of explicit and implicit members. Explicit members include the primary CDN, which is the initiator of a peering relationship, and any peering CDNs who cooperate for resource sharing. Implicit members are content providers and end-users. Implicit members are transparent to a peering arrangement but they share the benefit from it. In addition, users can vary based on the purpose, size, scope and duration of peering. For instance, a short-term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time frame\uf8e7as it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the evolved niche. On the other hand, establishment of a long-term peering arrangement calls for a human-directed agent to ensure that any resulting decisions comply with participating CDNs\u2019 strategic goals. Users can also be classified because of the preferential treatment that they may receive due to the policy that pertains to a particular provider\u2019s business logic. Moreover, individual users (or a group of users) can have dynamic QoS requirements depending on the situations that will result in \u201ccustomized\u201d content delivery. Thus, users (or class of users) can be differentiated based on userdefined QoS specifications while accessing the service.",
        "The product (i.e. prototype system) enabling CDN peering is expected to be deployed it in a realworld test bed such as PlanetLab for global testing, observations, and for performance evaluation. In this regard, existing Web services technologies will be studied in detail to examine the feasibility of leveraging them. A modular implementation stack could be developed on top of the existing standard application layer (e.g. Apache, Tomcat) and protocols (e.g. HTTP, CDI, HTPC). A modular implementation approach would be useful to perform testing on modules at different stages to ensure correct implementation. It is anticipated that a cryptographically secure auction-based framework will be used to assist content replication among peered CDNs to allow incentives for all participants. Load information could be measured and disseminated within individual CDNs and among other CDNs using distributed load indices such as Distributed Hash Table (DHT) or variations of it. Request assignment and redirection could predominantly rely on DNS-level end-user assignment combined with a rudimentary request assignment policy such as weighted round-robin or least-loaded-first, which updates the DNS records to point to the most appropriate replica server of the peers.",
        "The challenges in developing the product include virtualization of multiple providers and offloading end-user requests from the primary CDN provider to peers based on cost, performance and load. Due to the proprietary nature of existing CDNs, limited information about response time or service cost is typically available from individual CDNs, and load balancing control is retained by an individual provider within its own Web servers. Therefore, request-redirections must occur over distributed sets of Web servers belonging to multiple CDN providers, without the benefit of the full information available, as in the single provider case. Moreover, an implementation model for the product enabling CDN peering could be based on a complex combination of attributes such as Web server responsiveness or load, expected network delay, or geographic location. Several of these potential attributes vary over time and there is no single repository for listing the value of attributes such as geographic location or expected delay for all Internet-connected systems. It is anticipated that the values used in a CDN peering implementation model are likely to be based on heuristics.",
        "Along with the software product, a user manual would be written to help people understand the working methodology and usage of the developed prototype system. It would be written for nontechnical individuals and the level of content or terminology would differ considerably from, for example, a System Administration Guide, which is more detailed and complex. The user manual would follow common user documentation styles capturing purpose and scope of the product along with key system features and operations; step-by-step instructions for using the system including conventions, messaging structures, quick references, tips for errors and malfunctions; pointers to reference documents; and glossary of terms.",
        "The product would build on leveraging existing systems. In this regard, necessary inspirations could be obtained by analyzing related systems such as CoDeeN, Coral, Globule, and MotusNet. In particular, the design and implementation approach of MotusNet could be helpful to draw a clear guideline for developing the intended prototype.",

        "Automatically: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent on information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information / parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved; Business Rule: A narrative description of policies, procedures, or principles within an organization. Business rules can be divided in to four categories: definitions, facts, constraints, and derivations; Definitions are business rules that define entities and attributes; Facts are either links (relationships) between entities or associations between an entity and attributes; Constraints are conditions about the data that must always be true. They are the integrity rules that protect the data in the eventual database; Derivations are business rules that materialize a new piece of information (often attribute values) from other pieces of information. For example, a mathematical derivation might specify that you can obtain a person's age by subtracting his or her birth date from the current date; Commit/Rollback: An individual transaction is processed (commit) or discarded (rollback) by the proponent maintainer of the data items involved; Discretionary Access Controls (DAC): A means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission on to any other subject; Dynamically Generated Processing: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent upon information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information/parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved; Location Transparency: occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the applications and users of the database system. For example, a view that joins table data from several databases provides location transparency because the user of the view does not need to know where the data originates from; Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Imediates access to an object based on the clearance level of the subject (user) and the sensitivity label of the object. (These controls are always enforced above any discretionary control implemented by users); Mirrored Databases: Replication and maintenance of a database on a transaction basis for the purpose of rapid error or failure recovery as supported by the resident COTS RDBMS own system utilities and operating system; Object: A passive entity that contains or receives information. Access to an object potentially implies access to the information it contains. Examples of objects are records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory trees, and programs, as well as bits, bytes, words, fields, processors, video displays, keyboards, clocks, printers, and network nodes; Proponent Scheme: Describes the sites at which databases are replicated and also who owns and has update authority with respect to the data at each site. It refers to proponency at the source and record level; Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): A RAID system appears as one very large, reliable disk to the CPU. The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability. RAID has the same advantages as shadowing and striping at a lower cost. There are several types/levels of RAID implementations, including: RAID 0 (known as disk striping), RAID 1 (known as disk shadowing), RAID 3 (in which data is distributed in small increments across all data disks and adds a parity value to a separate disk for recovery if any disk fails, RAID 4 (in which data is distributed in large chunks across all data disks and also has a single parity disk. RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for small transfers. RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt to further improve performance). In a RAID 5 implementation, the data is stored as are check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array. If one disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate the lost data. Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level implementations to improve performance and reliability; Remote Data Access (RDA): is an ISO (9579) application layer interoperability standard (protocol and formats) to support access by an application to a (remote) DBMSs over an OSI network. The goal of RDA is to allow interoperability between applications (clients) and databases (servers) of different manufacturers so that an application is able to read and update data in remote databases via well defined standards. RDA defines a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL commands to these services. RDA also defines an interface to ISO (transaction processing) two phase commit TP services in the case where updates to multiple remote databases need to be coordinated. RDA does not yet define interoperability between server databases (i.e. it is not yet a standard for distributed database management); Replication Scheme: Information that precisely identifies DBs, or partitions of DBs, to be copied and/or distributed, replication schedules, and master/remote sites that are to receive the copies; Spatial DBMS: Geographic information system that organizes and maintains spatial data (i.e. data with graphical attributes) in terms of type, scale, location(s), extent, topology and geometry. Supports queries of spatial data where the selection criteria are defined by spatial attributes; SRI: A Standing Request For Information (SRI) is a capability in which CASS monitors for the occurrence of conditions established by an application program, and notifies the calling or establishing application program when the conditions are satisfied. An SRI may be one of three types: timer-based, data-based, or message-based; Subject: An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device that causes information to flow among objects or changes the system state. Technically, a process/domain pair; Transaction Journalling: Individual messages or database transactions are stored in a journal file, which may be a linear log file or a circular file.",
        "The metadata and procedures are described for the current Information Resource Submittal Package . Metadata and Related Information An XML tag may be described as any object and is easily created by anyone using a text editor. Although XML is a relatively new technology, many developers are already using XML in operational COE systems and have already created tags and specifications, many of which may be inconsistent with tags used in other systems. So far, the burgeoning sets of XML tags have created redundancy and irrelevancy, and they lack validity; XML Registry. To ensure interoperability, this registry provides a baseline set of tags developed through coordination and approval among the Community. The Registry allows a user to browse, search, and retrieve data that satisfy your requirements. The Registry has a substring search capability so that the user may easily find information resources that meet the criteria. The user may specify whether to search for the term within the name of the information resource or the definition or both; Developer's Role. Developers are urged to review the baseline tags, adopt them where possible, and subscribe to future notifications about the tags. If, after reviewing the tags in the Registry, you cannot reuse an existing specification (a.k.a. Document Type Definition (DTD)) or existing tags, you may submit your proposed tag to a Community of Interest (COI) and provide amplifying information for all to understand the semantics for its proper use; COE Chief Engineer's Role. The COE Chief Engineer will approve a single Point of Contact (POC) for a COI to manage the tags within that COI. The COE Chief Engineer will reserve ultimate authority to mediate any unresolved disputes within all COIs; The COE Data Engineering Team's Role. Tags and semantics will be analyzed to identify opportunities to consolidate tags towards a single or a minimal number of representations. A \"market forces\" model can also guide COE Data Engineering in identifying the weak candidates from the strong.8; The Community of Interest's POC's Role. (The information in the following section is current as of 17 May, 1999. Please consult the Registry for the most authoritative list of information resources types.)

Example: CTRY_CD, CTRY_NM, CTRY_ABBRD_NM, CTRY_OFF_NM, CTRY_SCP_NT_TX, and CTRY_PSTL_NM are all characteristics (ER-attributes) for the entity CTRY. In the relational world, they are columns within the table ctry, attributes of the entity ctry in er-modeling, and member attributes in object modeling. It would be expected that a submitter would identify them as attributes rather than elements. But if they were identified as attributes of the element ctry, then the additional baggage (other attributes) must be carried, or submitted as separate elements. We wish to limit the proliferation of tags, so we strongly urge folks to use XML_Attributes sparingly.",
